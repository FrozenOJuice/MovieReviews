    "text": "Movies like Venom and Morbius need to be Rated R. They would be significantly better if they weren't restrained. And we've now seen multiple highly successful Rated R superhero movies (Deadpool, Logan). I'm BEGGING the movie studios to have the courage to go all out.But that's far from the only reason this movie failed for me. Venom was still awesome as a PG-13 movie. So why didn't I love this? I love superhero movies. I love vampire stuff. This should have been a layup for me. It didn't even have to be good. Entertaining and cool would have been enough.Unfortunately this movie is a complete mess. It's poorly made in most aspects. The story is disjointed, the dialogue is basic, the character depth is barely there, the relationships are superficial. But all of this could be forgiven if you just give me awesome, entertaining action scenes. My friend put it best: \"The action was gibberish.\" You couldn't see anything.I really tried to like this movie. I tried forgiving the poor quality in hopes of some mindless entertainment. But it never came. And the climax/conclusion has zero impact.The only things that stood out to me as positives are one early action scene, and the visuals during the action scenes. The action itself is terrible, but the effects during some of the slow-mo shots are visually appealing.After a fantastic start with Venom (8 stars) and Spider-verse (8 stars), the Sony Marvel side universe has faltered with Venom Carnage (5 stars) and failed with Morbius. Please do better. I know you are capable of making great movies. (1 viewing, opening Thursday 3/31/2022)SPOILERS (also for Spider-Man: No Way Home)The mid-credits scenes are... puzzling. They show the sky-splitting effects from No Way Home, and the Vulture transfers to the Sony Marvel universe. I can't come up with any logical reason this would happen. In No Way Home, they sent everyone back to their universe of origin. But for the Vulture, that's the MCU. So why would he switch?On top of that, they have this super weak Sinister Six setup. And it doesn't flow with where the character Morbius is at the end of this movie. He seems to be \"a good guy,\" but now he wants to join a villain gang? I guess you could argue that they're not know to be a villain gang at this point, but as a viewer it doesn't feel right.1) The post credit scene in Venom Carnage teases us with the possibility of beast Tom Hardy as Venom vs MCU Spider-Man.2) Immediately followed by a middle finger to the fans when No Way Home cancels that possibility by sending Venom home.3) Now this Morbius mid-credit scene debacle.I have to ask, what were they thinking?",

    "text": "\"Morbius\" is an Action - Adventure movie in which we watch Dr. Michael Morbius, a biochemist trying to find the cure behind an extremely rare blood disease. He infects himself and he is completely changed by it.I have to admit that I do not understand the reason behind the low rating of this movie. I am not saying that it's a masterpiece and it does not have any flaws but it does not also worth that low rating. I can understand that it's small duration didn't help the main character to evolve and I believe that there was not enough time for the end of it. The interpretations of both Jared Leto who played as Dr. Michael Morbius and Matt Smith who played as Milo were good and their combination worked very well. To sum up, I have to say that \"Morbius\" is a nice, entertaining action movie and I recommend you to watch it because I am sure you will enjoy it and I advise you to lower your standards before watching it otherwise you will be disappointed.",

    "text": "Dangerously ill with a rare blood disorder and determined to save others suffering his same fate, Dr. Morbius attempts a desperate gamble.While at first it seems to be a radical success, a darkness inside him is unleashed.Will Morbius succumb to his mysterious new urges.....You know when a studio knows that a film may be in trouble, when they plaster the Marvel name everywhere on the poster, just in case nobody knows who M\u00f6bius is. And this film is a lot of trouble.It's nowhere near as bad as a lot of reviewers have said, but its the same as saying a hammer to the foot is better than the hand. It's clunky, unfunny, and worse of all, boring.Leto looks so uninterested with his character, and lacks the oomph that M\u00f6bius needs. Yes, whilst he is in vampire form, it's undeniably pretty cool to look at, but its all CGI and only took a green screen and Leto wearing a few ping pong balls. So Leto is a major problem, he's a good actor, and has been in some fascinating films, but this is him just phoning it in.The rest of the cast are okay, Smith is really chewing the scenery with his Milo, and whereas in other films he would grate like Ruby Rhod, he brings some much needed life to the film when he's ever in it.The nods to the MCU are so in your face, that it makes you wonder if the studio thought the audience would forget it's in the MCU. There is a daily bugle, and then the end credit sequences that are only there just to reiterate to the audience that they are watching another MCU film.The boat is named the Murnau a nod to Nosferatu, M\u00f6bius uses his lab like a gym, a reference to The fly. This just makes you want to watch those films, because they are infinitely better.And if the slow motion was taken out of this film, it would only be fifteen minutes long, there is that much in this film.It's too dark to be camp, too self-absorbed to be funny, and this is what the film desperately needs.It's one of those films that you will go back to again and again, just for the 'what the' factor.It's not the poorest comic book movie ever made, the remake of Fantastic Four holds that crown, but it's on a par with Superman 4 and Batman & Robin, rubbish, but for some reason you can't help but watch it every once in a while.",

    "text": "Dr Michael Morbius(Jared Leto, playing the role fairly lowkey, perhaps to avoid reminding people of Juggalo Joker. ...I mean, he's playing a vampire. Just saying, iIt's not unreasonable to expect some ham) has a rare blood disease. He figures that the answer is bats, and tests it on himself. Let's be honest, who of us wouldn't do that, in that situation? Of course, it goes wrong and he becomes a creature of the night, which is a slight upgrade from merely dressing, talking and moving like one.I am at this point slightly concerned that I may have made this sound more interesting, complex, and unconventional, than it actually is. In a lot of ways this feels like it should have come out 15 to 20 years ago. It's been in development for that amount of time, so maybe they just didn't do that much to change it anytime recently, to keep it up-to-date, since this is a subgenre that has evolved tremendously in that time? Without a doubt if this had come out one to two decades ago, we would be looking at it as a product of its time, rather than something that is completely out of date. It still wouldn't be good. Not even close. But we'd be going easier on it than we, rightfully, are now.Clearly Matt Smith is enjoying himself. And his enthusiasm is infectious. For a while I was thinking, \"it doesn't really fit with the rest of what's on screen but it is fun watching him metaphorically dance all over the place\". And then he started doing that literally. On more than one occasion. In separate scenes. The action is decent, although the meh, and at times possibly unfinished, special effects do make it harder to make out. This was clearly trimmed down, and a lot of the things we were excited about from the trailers are either majorly altered or a scene that is now just a clip with narration.I recommend this to those who miss the bad old days of the first Ghost Rider flick. 3/10.",

    "text": "Greetings again from the darkness. Trust the science, they said. Dr. Michael Morbius is a brilliant doctor/scientist who has devoted his life to formulating a cure for the rare and crippling blood disease he and his friend Milo were born with. This is an origin story pulled from the Marvel comic book characters created by Roy Thomas and Gil Kane. The film is directed by Daniel Espinosa (LIFE 2017, SAFE HOUSE 2012) with a script adapted by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, who previously collaborated on DRACULA UNTOLD (2014) THE LAST WITCH HUNTER (2015) and GODS OF EGYPT (2016). Sometimes past work tells you what you need to know.An opening sequence features the always cool shots of a helicopter zipping around the water and cliffs of Costa Rica, before landing at the mouth of a cave that houses zillions (I counted) of vampire bats. The brilliant Dr. Morbius plans to blend vampire at blood with human blood in his latest try at finding a cure. All of his work is funded by the ultra-rich and equally suffering Milo, both men desperate for relief from their deteriorating bodies. We flashback 25 years to a clinic in Greece where young Michael (Charlie Shotwell, CAPTAIN FANTASTIC, 2016) and Milo (Joseph Esson) first meet as they are being treated with regular blood transfusions by Dr. Nikolis (Jared Harris, \"Mad Men\").Jared Leto stars as Dr. Michael Morbius, who is known in Marvel comics as \"The Living Vampire\", so we kinda know where things are headed. It's a surprisingly subdued performance by an actor renowned for his characterizations that are anything but. His grown-up friend Milo is played by the always entertaining Matt Smith, and Morbius' love interest and research partner is Dr. Martine Bancroft (an excellent Adria Ariona). You've probably guessed that the blood blend works ... right up until it turns Morbius into a blood thirsty killing machine. This puts FBI agents played by Tyrese Gibson and (master of wisecracks) Al Madrigal on his trail. And yes, we know this is headed to the high noon (or midnight) showdown between childhood blood buddies and it's the do-the-right-thing Morbius versus the 'hey, I like this superhuman power' Milo.The first segment of the film does a terrific job of setting the stage, but the story, the characters, and the execution let us down for the final two acts. The fight scenes feature some of the worst special effects I've seen in years. Sure, the film's release has been delayed a couple of years, but that's no excuse for what we see. On the bright side, some of the effects do work, and Matt Smith is fun to watch in a couple of his scenes. We do wish for more of Martine's story, and for a better story overall (after the intro). The film is part of the SSU (Sony Spider-man Universe) and perhaps its best comparison is VENOM, sans the chuckles. It's clear this film's mission was to set the stage for a sequel, and that becomes even more obvious in the mid-credit scenes. Normally, I wouldn't mention this, but since the director has already discussed, and an appearance was made in SPIDER-MAN: NO WAY HOME, I believe it's fair game. The great Michael Keaton pops in as Adrian Toomes (aka Vulture), giving us an indication where the sequel is headed.Opening in theaters April 1, 2022.",

    "text": "Underwhelmed as I left the theater, I thought maybe I missed something but my trip here to the review pages confirms my opinion. Forgetting about the Morbius character's ties to the Marvel Comic Book franchise, this is basically a run of the mill vampire flick, and unfortunately, it doesn't break any new ground for the genre. The story is somewhat ordinary, as Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) seeks a cure for a rare blood disease, and by experimenting with bats, manages to turn himself into a creature of the night. His childhood friend Milo (Matt Smith), who helped fund the research for a cure, self infects with the same serum and discovers a lust for power that comes with the transformation. It's a pretty tepid plot line that results in some head scratching CGI considering how far special effects have evolved to the present day. More effective is the virtually seamless facial metamorphosis from human to vampire and back again, but it's something you expect nowadays and not particularly innovative. It all brings into question why the filmmakers would go for such a tired and formulaic approach for a vampire super-hero. When all is said and done, you can't even say that Morbius came out of the picture as a good guy, as his options didn't suggest much more than defeating Milo's alter-ego in a final vampiric showdown.",

And that he is being played by a guy who also portrayed the Joker.That aside, I can see that some people don't like the movie. The CGI isn't that good - especially considering the budget this must have had. There is also a dance (by the main villain) that reminds us of the bad dance by Tobey Maguire in Spiderman 3 ... also as cringeworthy as the one from back then. We then also get a Kayser Soze moment. Well not as iconic as the one from the Usual Suspects ... but it still is there.We have a lot of scary faces, but not a lot of blood. Considering the violence and the death that are occuring ... this does not display them as visual as it could. But if it did, this wouldn't have gotten a PG-13 now would it? While this is a Marvel character, it is owned by Sony .. but as you may be aware there are other things that seem to get .. into the mix. One of them has an appearance during the credits ... in two scenes. No scene after the credits .. but those two scenes suggest something that Jared Leto has already hinted at himself ... an new Universe is building ... well if the powers to be and the box office allows them to.Not a bad movie overall, but lacking a few things, even though the actors and the cinematography are not to be blamed (the latter has some bad moments especially during the last fight, where I couldn't tell where up and down was) ... sound was amazing, but I watched it in an Atmos cinema, so there's that. Very flawed but not as bad as some probably think it is ... it is an origin story and is quite stale pace wise ... but it is what it is.",

Their doctor Emil Nikols (Jared Harris) noted Michael's exceptional intellect and sent him off for further studies. Presently, Michael has become a brilliant doctor and scientist who had been able to develop life-saving artificial blood which earned him a Nobel Prize.Working on the anti-thrombotic elements of the saliva of vampire bats he had collected from Costa Rica, Michael invented a drug which could cure the affliction he (and Milo) suffered from. However, because human trials were illegal for such substances, he conspired with his girlfriend Dr. Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona) to inject the serum into him on a ship on international waters. The terrifying effects were not what they were expecting.Morbius was a character from Marvel Comics that I had no idea about. This was a Sony release, like the original Spider-Man and adjacent characters like Venom and Carnage, and so it won't be directly connected with main Marvel Cinematic Universe which is under Disney. There is controversy among fans how Sony was confusing the story arc of the MCU, like seeing Tom Holland's Spider-Man in the closing credits of \"Venom.\"Being his origin story, we see how Morbius met his best friend and blood brother Milo, and how his bold experiments had brought their friendship into the next level. Jared Leto played Morbius all moody, broody, and mired in his moral predicament, in sharp contrast with Matt Smith (best known as the 11th incarnation of the Doctor in \"Doctor Who\" and Prince Philip in \"The Crown\") who played Milo all loud, gleeful and manic.Aside from the vampiric transformations, CG effects ranged from subtle (like his ear wiggling for echolocation) to bombastic (like his high-speed wave forms tinged with bright colors from his clothing). Director Daniel Espinosa effectively created an atmosphere of dread and horror, but kept things within a PG rating. A character last seen in \"Spider-Man: Homecoming\" appeared in the closing credits scenes hinting a Multiverse connection. 6/10.",

Some of the people (the top review on this site) seems to have not even seen the movie. The movie definitely drags in parts and the vampire faces definitely look strange but it's nothing crazy to complain about. It's not perfect but it's way better then Venom 1 and dare I say Venom 2. Matt Smith was great in his role and Leto was decent in it too. Stop hating it just cause of the company that produces it (remember they made no way home!) they changed a few things regarding Spider-Man stuff from the trailer but they seem to have a plan with it all and I'll trust them till I see the future of it cause I'm not small minded. It's fun, it's not supposed to be a masterpiece! Get over yourselves and be better fans.",

For those unfamiliar with the character, Jared plays Doctor Michael Morbius, a biochemist with a rare blood disease and he has spent his life looking for a cure. He was also a villain that tangled with Spider_Man a lot in the comics before he turned good-kind of like how Venom did. Matt is Jared's childhood friend that has the same disease. In his search, Jared experiments with vampire bat enzymes and comes up with a serum that cures his disease but also changes himself into a vampire feeding on blood. Of course, Matt wants the cure too but Jared thinks it's too dangerous. Adria is Jared's lab assistant/doctor friend that helps him and when dead bodies start showing up-drained of blood-Tyrese plays the F. B. I. Agent that is investigating the murders. The fights are not as good as the ones in the last Spider_Man movie-maybe I was just expecting too much-so it was a little bit of a let down. There are 2 scenes as the end credits start-nothing at the very end-that hint at a sinister sequel.It's rated PG-13 for violence, frightening images and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 44 minutes.As I said, I love super hero movies so I would probably buy it on DVD. But if you are unfamiliar with Morbius, it might be better as a rental.",

    "text": "Morbius (2022) follows Michael Morbius as he tries to cure himself of a rare blood disease, but eventually ends up accidentally turning himself into a vampiric being. I had very low expectations for this film, and I guess you could say this film met them! It really was a complete mess of a film, but this made it entertaining occasionally.Firstly, Jared Leto was already a bad pick, portraying the character with no emotions and no likeability to him so I really didn't care what happened to him. I also feel like the characters were VERY poorly written which didn't help, with a super forced unnecessary romance. Matt Smith was the main redeemable quality of this film, he tried his best and at least brought an ounce of personality.Speaking of the writing, the humour felt incredibly flat. It was probably the weakest attempt I've seen in a Sony or Marvel film. The only times I laughed were when I was cringing because the film made me THAT uncomfortable. However, I did somewhat enjoy hate-watching for the bad humour.The visual effects and cinematography was okay. The CGI for the most part wasn't terrible in comparison with the other elements of this film, but there were some moments that stuck out in a negative way. The fight scenes looked okay but were also incredibly goofy to the point where I often laughed at them.The pacing of this film was an absolute mess, The movie really proves the phrase 'time flies when you're having fun' wrong, as this film felt like it went by in about 45 minutes. It also ends incredibly abruptly and doesn't attempt to come to a proper conclusion, it felt unfinished.Lastly, the end credit scenes were completely unnecessary. Both of the scenes were pretty much the same, and were just a petty attempt at trying to cram all the characters into one universe again.",

It was a joy to see Matt Smith (Doctor Who) as Lucian/Milo.The rest of the cast of was and I enjoyed seeing Adrian Toomes (portrayed by Michael Keaton), also known as the Vulture turn up mid credits which of course is setting up Dr Strange And The Multiverse Of Madness.I don't understand the negative reviews, Leto was perfect as Michael Morbuis, the special effects were good and the story, although PG, it should have been an R, really worked.Hopefully there will be a sequel that will be more of an R rating that would suit Morbuis' darker story and origins.",

    "text": "There is the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and there is the spin-off Spider-Man Universe, which stemmed from Venom, and that is the universe that this story exists in, to bring us perhaps one of the lesser known in the comic books, and I was willing to give it a chance, directed by Daniel Espinosa (Safe House, Life). Basically, at a hospital in Greece, ten-year-old Michael Morbius (Charlie Shotwell) forms a close bond with his surrogate brother Lucien, whom he renames Milo (Joseph Esson). They both share a rare blood disease and desire to be free of their illness and to be \"normal\". Their adoptive father and hospital director Dr. Emil Nicholas (Jared Harris) arranges for Michael to attend medical school in New York while he focuses on caring for Milo. Twenty-five years later, Michael (Jared Leto) is awarded the Nobel Prize for his outstanding achievement in biochemistry, creating synthetic blood that saved many lives, but he publicly declines the award. Michael has recently returned from Costa Rica and has secretly captured dozens of vampire bats, which his colleague Martine Bancroft (Emerald City's Adria Arjona) discovers. Michael hopes to splice the genes of the bats with his own to develop a cure for his condition. He visits Milo (Matt Smith), still being cared for by Nicholas, and informs him of his planned illegal experiment. After receiving funding from Milo to outfit a private mercenary vessel in international waters with his equipment. After running tests on a lab rats, Michael and Martine are pleased by a successful solution being created, and Michael is ready for the human trial, on himself. Michael drinks the solution, but is instantly transformed into a monstrous vampire, knocking Martine unconscious, and killing all crew members aboard, and draining their blood. Michael regains his senses after his bloodlust subsides, but has no memory of his actions, and is horrified after watching the CCTV. He erases the CCTV footage of his experiment and what happened, calls the authorities to locate the vessel, and jumps overboard, leaving Martine unconscious. Michael returns to New York and is amazed by his newfound superhuman strength, speed, reflexes, and echolocation (hearing distant sounds), and his vampire bats are at one with him. He is able to walk in sunlight, but remains in his lab, maintaining his lust of blood with his synthetic blood until it gradually ceases to satisfy his needs and time to do so is decreasing. The vessel is located and investigating FBI agents Simon Stroud (Tyrese Gibson) and Alberto \"Al\" Rodriguez (Al Madrigal) deduce Michael's involvement in the deaths. Michael is questioned but released with no substantial evidence on suspicion of murder. Milo learns that Michael has found a cure but is furious when Michael refuses to give it to him, warning him of its danger. Martine awakens in hospital, but also does not give any real answers to the FBI questions. Michael visits Martine and is shocked to discover the body of a dead nurse. Believing to be responsible for her death, he tries to escape, but is cornered and arrested. Milo visits Michael in prison and offers to use his wealth to get him out. But Michael realises that Milo has taken the cure and killed the nurse. Michael manages to escape and finds Milo in a subway station, he is unrepentant, confessing his bloodlust-induced crime, he urges Michael to embrace his powers. Unwilling to hurt his brother, Michael flees. Michael meets Martine to explain everything, from the positives of the cure to the hideous crimes of Milo. Finding an underground criminal lair, Michael scares away a gang and acquires a new lab to develop an anticoagulant to stop and kill Milo. He also intends to use the solution on himself since he will become unable to resist his bloodlust. Stroud and Rodriguez find footage of one of Milo's attacks, they believe Michael, as a vampire, is spreading a curse and the story is released to the media to track him down. Nicholas sees the footage and recognises Milo carrying out the attack in the subway. Milo returns and Nicholas pleads with him to stop, Milo is angered he may prefer Michael, he responds by wounding him and calling Michael. Nicholas dies in Michael's arms while Milo goes on to attack Martine. Michael returns to Martine, but he is too late, she also dies in his arms, and he drinks her blood. Michael confronts Milo and, as vampires, they brutally fight in an abandoned underground construction. Milo overpowers Michael, until he summons an army of bats to restrain him, allowing him to inject the anticoagulant. Milo momentarily mourns his surrogate brother as he dies, then he flies away with his bats as the authorities surround the area. Michael mourns the loss of his loved ones and embraces his identity as a vampire. Michael is unaware that his vampiric powers have entered Martine's bloodstream, and she is revived with newly developed powers. Meanwhile, Adrian Toomes aka Vulture (Michael Keaton) when he finds himself transported by a spell (by Doctor Strange) from Peter Parker's universe into Michael's and is released from prison. He later approaches Michael and suggests that they join forces. Also starring Corey Johnson as Mr. Fox and Joanna Burnett as Nurse Kristen Sutton. Leto has followed his deserved Oscar win in Dallas Buyers Club with some disappointing performances, from a terrible punk Joker in Suicide Squad to a Razzie winning over-the-top Italian idiot in House of Gucci, thank goodness here he is tolerable and suitably moody, Arjona is beautiful and does well, but Smith gives a scene-stealing performance as the villain with a dry and dark sense of humour. It is a fairly predictable story of a biochemist trying to cure himself of a deathly disease and becoming something nasty in the process, the anti-hero plot is a bit disjointed at times, the friend turned enemy and horrors elements are reasonable, you want to see where it's going, and you cannot deny the special effects are fantastic, so it's worthwhile enough superhero vampire action.

Fortunately he isca brilliant scientist, and his research leads to a vampire bat-based serum. For anyone who has ever seen a science fiction or horror film, or read a comic, the side effects will come as no surprise.This movie has come in for moderate criticism which, in my view, isn't wholly deserved. The story is solid, if unsurprising, a routine superhero origin. The cast are all good. The effects are well executed.The problems, because there are for sure problems, come down to script and direction. There are areas which need explanation but none is offered - why does Michael call Lucien Milo? What exactly are the powers which come with the treatment? Dressed up in special effects, there is an echo-location thingie, also some sort of smeary thing which is flying? I dunno. The fact that the effects often take place in extreme darkness and rapidly edited jigglecam adds to the difficulty in following what's going on. This shouldn't be difficult to follow - it's a straightforward story - but the director seems to have sacrificed clarity in favour of style, and this was not a good decision. The scenes setting up follow-ups also have an element of \"Huh?\"This is not as bad as it's painted, but it should have been much better.The interaction of Sony's Spiderverse with Disney's MCU continues to intrigue and entertain.",

    "text": "The latest incarnation of a Marvel Comics character in director Daniel Espinosa's \"Morbius,\" starring Oscar winner Jared Leto as the shape-shifting vampire, hasn't proven itself the blockbuster either Sony Pictures or the public sought. The studio greenlighted this $75 million anti-heroic epic after the phenomenal success of the audacious \"Venom\" movies. \"Morbius\" shares little in common with the two Tom Hardy outings. For example, legendary biochemist Michael Morbius has no symbiotic sidekick who provides comic relief. Although \"Morbius\" debuted with a healthy $39 million haul its first weekend, the super villain saga suffered a steep setback, plunging 73 percent during its second weekend, coining a mere $10.2 million in ticket sales. Film critics have panned it. Now, it also seems the public is less than elated. The Screen Rant website reported: \"'Morbius' didn't go over well with audiences and currently boasts the lowest CinemaScore of any Marvel-based movie since 2015's 'Fantastic 4.'\" Meantime, The Direct website added: \"'Morbius' will have suffered the second-worst box office drop in the superhero genre right after NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal's 'Steel' from 1997.\"Apparently the critics and the public must have forgotten \"Morbius\" is a supervillain. Were they anticipating a carbon copy of \"Venom?\" Mind you, the PG-13 rated \"Morbius\" is far darker than the typical Marvel superhero saga. Nothing about this 105-minute origins epic is remotely facetious. Morbius doesn't don a spandex outfit like he did for his debut in The Amazing Spider-Man comic #101 (October 1971), and nobody spouts any clever dialogue. Basically, \"Morbius\" emerges as a horror fantasy laden with allusions to \"Dracula\" and \"Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde.\" When Michael transforms from a sickly to a scary person, he doesn't resemble an urbane Christopher Lee in a dinner jacket. Instead, he appears repulsive, like a skull-faced demon from an \"Exorcist\" knock-off. Clearly, the critics and the public alike wanted something far more flamboyant.Sony and Disney own the rights to various Marvel characters. The Disney Marvel characters are appealing. \"Iron Man,\" \"Captain America,\" \"Black Widow,\" and \"Thor\" are role models for kids. Indeed, these characters are immaculate, while Michael Morbius knows his evil potential and wrestles with his split-personality. \"Dracula Untold\" co-scenarists Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless appropriated story material from Bram Stoker's classic novel \"Dracula.\" Not only is the sovereign vampire mentioned in dialogue excerpts, but the narrative also features a ship cruising outside the 12-mile limit in international waters. Several thugs armed with assault rifles die hideously on it. Similarly, in \"Dracula,\" the eponymous vampire exsanguinated the entire crew of the Demeter. For the record, a different version of this incident occurred in \"The Amazing Spider-man\" comic book. Sazama & Sharpless paint a more sympathetic portrait of Morbius. When Morbius saw his colleague, Dr. Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona of \"The Belko Experiment\"), strewn unconscious on the floor of the ship's laboratory, he went berserk and massacred the mercenaries, rather like as Dracula did the Demeter crew. Once he realizes the enormity of his conduct, Morbius wipes the surveillance video clean and radios for help. None of the traditional Marvel characters would tolerate such an atrocity. Afterward, Morbius vows never to do anything as heinous again.Mind you, these mercenaries had nearly killed Martine, so Morbius' behavior could be deemed chivalric. As you can see, Espinosa takes things rather seriously as does Michael Morbius. Jared Leto looks convincing as a man cursed with a dreaded blood disease. Things don't really improve after he engineers artificial plasma for use on battlefields. Instead, Morbius discovers a cure. Unfortunately, the cure turns him into a monster! Moreover, one of Michael's closest friends, Milo (Matt Smith, the 11th \"Doctor Who\"), suffers from a condition similar to Milo's. Michael had promised to share any breakthrough treatment. The problem is Michael needs human blood, a luxury that only goes so far in its artificial format. Once he develops blood infused with vampire bat DNA, Michael faces the prospect of having to kill people. Meantime, Milo lacks Michael's discipline. If he cannot get what he wants, Milo will devour humans without a qualm. Essentially, Michael and Milo emerge as different sides of a coin. This difference enhances the dramatic tension between these childhood pals.\"Morbius\" opens in Costa Rica where our protagonist has gone to trap vampire bats for his blood work studies. Sony could have made a movie strictly about Morbius transporting these deadly vampire bats to New York City. We learn Morbius suffers from a rare, incurable, blood disease. During his youth, he spent many years in a sanitarium for special needs children. One day Dr. Emil Nicholas (Jared Harris of \"Lincoln\") introduces Michael to another young patient named Lucien. These two grow up and bond until Michael leaves the sanitarium to attend a special school for the gifted. As a renowned hematologist, Michael invents artificial blood, and an adult Lucien (Matt Smith) bankrolls Michael's research. His prestige as a researcher spreads when he not only wins the Nobel Prize but then refuses to accepts it.Neither Espinosa nor Sazama and Sharpless bite off more than they can chew with \"Morbius.\" The filmmakers acquaint audiences with Morbius as well as his predicament. Since his survival depends on drinking human blood, Morbius must come to terms with his destiny. Apart from Ang Lee's \"Hulk\" (2003), few traditional Marvel characters encounter such life-or-death extremes as Morbius. Essentially, the filmmakers have forged a character of greater depth than \"Iron Man,\" \"Captain America,\" \"Thor,\" and \"Dr. Strange.\" None of these superheroes face Morbius' challenge. Happily, overseas audiences have given \"Morbius\" a boost, buying $81 million in tickets to this sterling Sony release and raising its global haul to $148 million plus!",

Also, a lot of their vampire bat facts were true, so very good on doing your research for the script!And while I am a horror movie fan, I am glad that this wasn't a horror movie so that kids can enjoy watching this comic book story.To sum up, I did enjoy watching this movie :){SPOILERS ahead}\nHere is what they could have done 'better' (in my opinion) I don't like rating films thatI liked to be below a 7/10, so this is why I deducted some points away from a perfectly enjoyable movie:\nThe writing; I am a perfectionist and so I usually am not completely satisfied with an art project unless I see every angle as near air-tight as possible. I thought Agent Rodriguez' dialogue was a bit too much (I just found out he's played by a comedian but still)\nI wish the film had a bit more depth to it, Milo's character development into becoming a villain felt forced and not exactly 'believable' I guess, I just didn't see the reason for him to turn on and try and kill Michael. Also, while I am a Matt Smith fan, I would have had him act different post-serum than what was given instead (I like my villains deadly-serious) ...also how did Milo take the vampire serum if it needed to be injected into the spine by a second person?There was a few moments in the film where I thought the scene-palette could have been different, but the majority of the film had nice colours.I just didn't leave the theatre having that epic blood-rush flow through me as I do with a lot of superhero films, I can't exactly tell what it is the film lacked, but it's just this feeling in me of incompleteness.I would like to know what's in store next for Michael Morbius now that he is still possibly a wanted 'criminal'.Also, I got really pumped for this film when I watched the trailer on Youtube, and I notice that movies a lot of time now have this problem where the trailer is a bit more epic than all of what the film turned out to be. I didn't see the Spider-Man graffiti on the wall, Morbius being a bit lighthearted after delivering that \"I'm Venom\" line and Vulture bumping into Michael in the hall.And as a mild comment, I wasn't particularly fond of the title graphics at the beginning and end with the vector purple scheme (but that's just me as a graphic designer)\nI am excited to see how this Venom-verse will progress in the making of more films, I am excited. I really hope Morbius will continue to be in more of these films and getting some screentime with my favourite wall-crawling hero :)",

For a story line it was good for an origin story, I left the theater curious of where Sony was planning on taking morbius moving forward and how he will play into the rest of the Sony universe of Marvel characters.Spoilers!?!?One thing I don't really understand and are hoping they will clear up next time morbius shows up in a movie is the end credits...they portrayed morbius as a antihero throughout the entire movie then in the credits portray him as a villain teaming up with someone from the sinister six villain group so that definitely needs to be explained moving forward.Overall though I enjoyed the movie and look forward to morbius moving forward and especially hope to see him make an appearance in a blade movie.",

    "text": "So, from hearing about this Film I wasn't in any hurry to watch as previous films of the DC/MCU Universe haven't been great. But from seeing the scathing reviews left, right & center, made me think this probably wasn't going to be too bad. I was sort of right.The film sees Morbius trying to find a cure for his illness via creating artificial blood, but the side effects are far more devastating than he could've imagined as the new blood turns him into a blood thirsty Vampire. So, while trying to find a way to reverse the effects he simultaneously has to stop his friend with the same illness he has from causing havoc across the city after he himself is injected with the same artificial blood specimen.I found the film to be average. It's not amazing & is quite dull, hollow & soulless in a couple of areas which makes for a sort of mundane viewing. Saying that though, the story is simple, the action is pretty good if not as bout as average as it comes with super hero films & action films in general. The effects are pretty good also & the film has a great runtime of 1 hour & 33 minutes, 1 hour & 37 minutes including the mid & end credit scenes. The pacing wasn't too bad, if not a bit slow. The violence & gore could've been better as with the characters who felt flat & cardboard.Overall, it's average. It's not nearly as bad as what critics are saying. You'll enjoy it for what it is & should be enjoyed for that reason. Give it a watch, trust me.5/10.",

Morbius is pretty similar to the Venom movies (which would make sense as it's made by the same company), they're movies that you go into knowing they're kinda bad but you like them anyway.The first half of the movie I ended up really enjoying. My only complaints are what you would probably call nitpicking. I'm not a huge fan of how everything looks smokey, at first I thought this was Morbius's perspective with his echo/hearing, but then everything was smokey. Also this seems to completely copy Venom in the way where Morbius becomes a anti-hero, instead of a bad guy. Isn't Morbius supposed to be a villain? Is everyone gonna become a anti-hero?I was enjoying it until Milo (Matt Smith) becomes the antagonist, then it just kinda became stupid.But it isn't nearly as horrible as people are making it out to be. Y'all are dramatic lol.",

This movie doesn't even follow the rules it sets for itself. Morbius can't control himself when his colleague (and I guess love interest?) suffers what is the equivalent of a papercut but 5 minutes later he is totally able to ignore the buffet presented while kneeling over his eviscerated, soon-to-die mentor?

    "text": "Morbius was a movie I was interested in knowing about Michael Morbius's character that I read about in the comics. He was a troubled guy who wanted to make the world better in the comics. And when getting to the film has been delayed for almost two years since July 31, 2020. Unfortunately, however, Morbius, the film was not that. This movie is a complete mess. Hot Garbage. It's poorly made in almost all aspects. The story is disjointed, the basic dialogue, the character depth is barely there, and the superficial relationships. After No Way Home, Sony decided to put their fingerprints all over the movie, and every time they did that, it didn't go that well. If you look at Spider-man 3, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Venom, Venom: Let there be Carnage, and now this film, again, they want to be like the MCU instead of being their own thing. They want to make the films like the cinematic universe and kid-friendly characters. When it shouldn't be like that, characters like Morbius, Venom, and Carnage are not kid-friendly. These films need to be more adult than just ten years old; the movies like Logan, Deadpool, and Joker are box office successes and amazing films.Pros: Matt Smith stole the show, he was the best part of the movie, and I understand his motivation to be a villain and wanting to be cured. The visuals were amazing too. And I love the tone; it was by far better than Venom 1 and 2, as I always want the films to be serious when it needs to be.Cons: Everything else that was in the movie. This is an Avi Arad production, so my expectations were low going into this, and Matt Tolmach and Lucas Foster were also on board to make the stakes of success even lower than ever. It's boring. The writers didn't make the stakes evident, and the story flow was weak. The characters made the fact that we needed to care about these characters, besides Matt Smith's character. The love between Morbius and Bancroft was somewhat forced on me that many people need to have a love interest. However, this is still better than Eddie and Anne in the Venom movies. The ending ends, and it was the most disappointing thing I have ever seen. And the post-credits scenes, the better I forget about that existing, the better.Overall, Sony needs to stop with these films, and if they make movies without setting up a cinematic universe and without touching the films, these films would be levels like Deadpool, Logan, and Joker. But with this, I won't be watching anything else coming from Sony. Except for Spider-Man Across the Spider-verse Part 1 and 2, I hope Sony doesn't put their nasty fingerprints all over the film. 2/10. Disappointing.",

    "text": "SCORE: 6.2/10Alright, I'm going to do my best to review this as a film, mid/post credit scene aside, to start. For one, I don't understand the HATE for this movie. It took the exact formula of Venom and replaced the humor with intensity. I personally enjoyed this more than Venom. I was engaged throughout the entirety of the film and found myself somewhat excited to see what would happen next. Admittedly, acting was subpar in a few areas, the storytelling was pretty bad, and the entire movie felt a little off when it comes to pacing, but overall this was an enjoyable movie to watch.Now to talk about the mid/post credit scene. As a Marvel Fan, I have grown to be just as excited about the mid/post credit scene as I am about the film itself. I am in belief, just like in Venom, that a subpar movie can be enhanced by a meaningful mid/post credit scene. I am still in shock that whoever made the trailers for this movie decided to spoil the mid/post credit scene. If I had no idea that the Vulture was involved, those scenes would've enhanced my feeling towards this movie. I just want to meet the person whose idea it was to do that and understand the point of spoiling that part of the movie for the audience. It is almost on the same level of if we saw the portal scene of Andrew and Tobey coming through in the Spider-Man: No Way Home trailer. What were they thinking?",

Then, a scene where Morbius simply put 2 vials of the most dangerous serum that turns human to super vampire, on the table just like that. I mean, he should have hidden them somewhere safe and secure!The rest of the movie, is, rather good. And Jared's acting is on point. Not great, but not bad either. Matt Smith's acting as a villain is more prominent, I have to be honest.The CGI, is also NOT THAT BAD. Acceptable to me, not sure what others are talking about.Action packed, well choreographed fight scenes, and good continuity. Effects that aren't too over the top, and balanced with a good story.Obviously Morbius won't top The Avengers but I'd definitely say this movie is even better than Wonder Woman 1984. Worth to watch for all Marvel fans.",

Why would anything be surprising if you live in a world of superheroes, aliens & magic?That's why this movie is more watchable than other outings, as it chooses to ignore or neglect to mention its cinematic counterparts, making it more a self-contained stand alone movie. Some may scoff at the scientific creation of vampirism, discarding the mythology and lore, but one does not necessarily cancel the other.Matt Smith is quite effective in his villainous turn, and it has a certain dark atmosphere that helps, even if it may evoke similarities to other films.",

    "text": "I had high hopes for this movie. For what it is, it is good. If you are a comic book fan, then you are going to be disappointed. I am ranking this at a 7 because if you are new to this character and just watching it with no bais then you are going to like this movie.For action, there is a ton of it. It would have been greatly enhanced if it had been done in 3D. No sex scenes, and mild cussing, allows for children of most ages to see it. However, with the onscreen CGI transformations it may cause nightmares.This aside. The story line follows a fast paced \"jump in\" style of story telling. You feel lost in the first few scenes of the movie and then gain footing about 20 minutes in. The best scenes sadly are what is shown in the trailers. That being said. There is a romantic side to this story, as many movies have. It is a man with a rare blood condition, who is above averagely smart who happens upon a formula crossing the DNA of a Vampire Bat with that of a Human, causing a hybrid al a Bruce Banner/Hulk. Dr. Michael Mobius is able to take on supernatural/superhuman abilities such as flight, sonar, and strength, as long as he feeds on a blood substitute that is slowly losing its ability for him to survive without drinking human blood.His one and only friend, a boy named Lucian \"Milo\" who happens to have the same type of blood issue as Morbius is his benefactor and pays for the controversial and state of the art treatments that leads to their mutual transformation into Vampire hybrids. And as any story arch goes, you have one who is good, and one who turns bad with the new found power. It then turns into a superhuman fight throughout new york with Morbius's love intrest getting caught up in the middle.",

Morbius is Boring: How do you make vampire superheroes boring? HOW???2. Ridiculously Inaccurate Science: It's a superhero movie, I accept garbage science and barely blink most of the time. The problem is when you mix basic facts from the real world with your fantasy science in completely ridiculous ways. For example, vampire bats are described as being capable of taking down mammals ten times their size. That is simply not what a vampire bat does at all.3. CGI: One of the worst uses of CGI in the history of the MCU. They borrowed the flight smoke effect from Harry Potter (that smoke you see when evil wizards are flying), changed the color of the smoke, and left it everywhere. Smoke trails over here. Smoke trails over there. No reason for the smoke trails, but let's just have them anyway. Notably, they don't seem to appear when vampires are seemingly teleporting between places, or being stealthy, but anytime there is a fight *bam* smoke. I can just imagine the director, \"This is a nice fight scene, but you know what it really needs? More smoke!\"4. Incomprehensible Fight Choreography: Vampire vs. Vampire fights should be amazing. They should be interesting. They should be fast and slick and filled with opportunities for clever action sequences. Instead, almost everything is left to the imagination because the camera cuts away from every blow, or the entire screen is just covered in smoke trails (MORE SMOKE), or the fight just makes no since from a physics point of view - like a slow blow somehow throws a character 40 feet across screen.5. Giant Plotholes: How did you get off the boat? Why do you not try to clear your name? Etc. Etc.And I could go on... at no point was this anything other than a train wreck.",

They discover a cure of sorts with dark consequences.This is a Sony Marvel comic book movie. I don't think it's completely bad but it's definitely not good. I don't want to mix up the comic book universes but I keep going back to The Joker saying \"Why so serious?\". This is a comic book movie in need of some fun. It doesn't have to be jokes or light silliness but I just want the audience to enjoy the film. That's what's missing here. There is no enjoyment. I don't care about this protagonist. The first hour is a long introductory first act. His CG action scenes are interesting for about five seconds but it turns into a lot of smoke and chaos signifying nothing. The writing's low point has to be the counterfeiting lab. Why is he taking over a counterfeiting lab? He's not using it to counterfeit money. He's not being a good guy arresting criminals. It would make more logic sense for him to take over an illegal drug lab. At least, a drug lab would have some of the needed equipment. I grow less forgiving of this movie with every passing thought. Sony is building out their cinematic universe and nothing more is achieved.",

First, vampire bats are nothing like how they're portrayed in this movie. Seriously, did the writers think that people know nothing about vampire bats? (2) How many super-fast, indestructible characters do we need in the Marvel Universe? When a character is this powerful there's absolutely no tension in the action scenes. (3) Morbius transformation into this superbeing is instantaneous. And he already knows how to use his new abilities.

    "text": "Oh dear, this film didn't go down all that well, but then again I can sort of see where the critcism of it does arise. Basically it is the origin story of a Spiderman villian, but they are trying to build a film around this particular villain, but also that a number of critics feel that separating the villain from the context of the superhero that they tend to fight doesn't work. Mind you, I thought the two Venom films worked quite well, and to be honest with you, I actually quite liked this film. In fact, the rather dark nature of the film made me feel that it doesn't really sit all that well in the type of Spiderman films that I have seen.Anyway, the film is about this doctor, Michael Morbius, who has a rare blood disease which means that his body can't produce blood, so he needs a blood transfusion on a daily basis. He is introduced to a friend who also has the disease and of course they end up becoming besties (or brothers for want of a better word - and also the word that the film happens to use). So, Morbius dedicates his life to finding a cure for this condition, and he comes upon the idea of using the DNA from a vampire bat, which actually backfires and turns him into a vampire.The rest of the film is basically Morbius coming to terms with the fact that he is now a vampire, but also dealing with his brother, who has since become immesurably wealthy, but has also taken the 'cure' but has decided that because he is now a powerful vampire, he should embrace the power and dominate people, as opposed to Morbius, who doesn't really want to hurt people (and the only people that he did hurt happened to be the thugs that were on the ship where he was conducting his experiments).Mind you, considering that Morbius is supposed to be a villain, or rather an anti-hero, which is what these films are exploring, you probably can forgive the fact that the film completely trashes the lives of these characters - which is what happens here. A sort of similar thing happened in Venom, but not to the same extent. Then again, Venom was a lot more light hearted, especially with the banter between Venom and Eddy Brock. However, this film is a lot darker, and there is also a suggestion that it might not be the same universe as the Venom universe, if the end credit sequence is anything to go by.Yeah, this didn't seem to appeal to all that many people, but I personally liked it. It certainly isn't one of the greatest films that I've seen, but personally, it works reasonably well, and I enjoyed it, though I doubt I would be rushing out to watch it again.",

Why is Milo's envy of Michael not mentioned previously? What does Milo want offer Michael, death or persuasion? Why are vampires not afraid of sunlight or holy water if they are \"Living Vampires\"? No Way Home didn't explain this, so why and how is the Vulture sent to Sony universe? Normally when a movie gives me confusion instead of introspection, it's not a good movie. Honestly, I feel bad for Jared Leto, he seems to pay maximum effort on all his characters, but the movie's are simply not appreciated (except for Dallas Buyers Club). Go check this film out if you want to see some cool effects, but be ready to sleep your way through. Lastly, Sony, don't you dare do a sequel.",

They cut out almost all of the shared-universe stuff (I think there was a reference to Venom somewhere) EXCEPT for Michael Keaton's end-of-film appearance. What a letdown.As for the film itself, it tries to be an entertaining piece on its own, but so much of it is either unexplained or poorly explained, like the whole fake-blood logic and the syringe used in the final act. Some of it just DIDN'T make sense: also the character development in this film was lacking because of the pacing focusing on establishing a superhero character as opposed to letting Jared Leto give some life to a dying scientist trying to cure himself and his best friend.What does work? Morbius himself doesn't LOOK too bad (his vampire form is okay, and his ears are nicely eerie to look at, especially with those hairs), and Matt Smith makes his hammiest Doctor Who moments look downright subtle, and Jared Harris is always nice to see even when he's underused (like he is here). The film was trying to work.The bad stuff? Well, the CGI was all over the place (looking either very good or very bad), the plotting was too empty for such interesting comic book characters, and Jared Leto himself was wasted as badly as Jared Harris.Morbius tries to work in spite of everything against it, but these characters need clearer direction, less murky CG-action and less stupid writing to make these Spider-Man supporting characters interesting.Morbius gets 1.5/5 stars. This vampire doesn't suck your attention up the way he ought to.",

When the antagonist Milo (Matt Smith) is more sympathetic than the protagonist Morbius (Jared Leto) then there is something missing or perhaps wrong about this film. The specials effects are decent & I think Marvel films have almost perfected the blueprints for doing this well.It is better than the Eternals but the bar to achieving that feat is not set that high. Marvel films have set such high standards over the years/past 2 decades that the average films like this sticks out like a sore thumb. Maybe if this was a DC film then people might rave about it more so.. & would be considered a decent attempt from DC films.Also, the fact Sony made this a PG rating to attract a larger audience may be too its own detriment. It should have been r rated; see how well the blade trilogy did. It is not a vampire film without the blood! What you get without it is poor excuse of a vampire film/franchise aka The Twilight Saga!",

The script and editing are all over the place and most of the special effects are a joke for a mainstream film coming out in 2022. It wouldn't be so bad if I could see there was an artistic vision, but it just happened to not be a vision that worked for me; however the issue here is that there's no artistry or vision at all. It feels like Sony just wanted to get another superhero out with as little effort as possible just to make them some money and allow them to cling to relevancy\n2) The film feels far too fast. The editing is so fast, almost to the point where cuts are put together that seem like something is missing in between. Also, nothing is ever stopped and explained at all, E.g. Why is Lucian called Milo for the whole film?? And how does he have so much money to fund all of Michael's research?? I rarely say this about a film, but this could've done with an extra 15 minutes to just give it room to breathe. I mean it literally finishes directly after the final fight scene, no coda? No ending to give a satisfying conclusion to each character arc?3) The two credits scenes are both terrible and feel so tacked on. They don't even make any sense in the context of the MCU. Between this and the No Way Home credits scene with Venom, it just feels like Sony are desperately trying to be involved in the MCU and Marvel are desperately pushing them away - it's embarrassing.",

Jared Leto as Michael Morbius was surprisingly mellow, and Matt Smith as the villain was weird, but it worked for what he was clearly trying to do with the character. But unfortunately no amount of Ok acting could save the mess that was these characters. Like, what in the world were the writers thinking??? The character motivations were wildly inconsistent, or downright insane throughout the entire movie! For example: throughout the movie Morbius is constantly talking about how much he values human life and how he doesn't want to kill anyone, and how he'll take his own life to prevent himself from murdering anyone. But guess what... the movie ends and he completely forgets the fact that he said he would kill himself to protect humanity! Seriously, go watch the movie and pay attention, it's clearly said and then never addressed again. It's like the writers refused to ever check their former work, they just wanted to finish the screenplay asap. And don't even get me started on the two agents in the movie. What in the world were they thinking with those two??? Every line they had was either a horribly flat joke, or one of the dumbest sentences in the entire film! I could not stand it whenever they were on the screen, they were just there to push the plot forward and diminish the intelligence of the movie-going audience.2. Inconsistencies and Dumb Contrivences.This may seem like nitpicking, but I'd call it bad writing. There were SO MANY inconsistencies in this movie that I started to wonder if they were doing it on purpose. One example is what I mentioned before about Morbius' noble statement of his intent to sacrifice himself, and then never doing that. But I think the most glaring example in my mind was when the two agents were chasing Morbius in a building. There was a giant room with a staircase that went up at least 20 stories, and Morbius used his power of flight to reach the top in seconds. He then immediately walks onto the roof and is about to jump off when out of nowhere one of the agents burst onto the roof!!!! How did he get up there that fast??? The movie very clearly showed how huge the building was and how quickly Morbius was moving, so did the agent use a teleporter? Such a ridiculous moment in the movie, and I promise you these types of things were throughout the entire runtime.3. Story.What. A. Horrible. Story. I'm no writer, but I've seen enough movies to know a good story, and this movie seems to be aggressively running away from being good. Why does everyone keep making excuses for Morbius killing the mercenaries that he had hired? Why does Matt Smith's character IMMEDIATELY turn evil with zero motivation and no foreshadowing? Why do Morbius and Bancroft kiss while she's dying when they have had ZERO romantic chemistry the whole time??? (Seriously, there was never even a hint they liked each other, except for the fact that they were both attractive people.) Why does Bancroft aggressively bite Morbius' lip and then lick his blood? Seems like a really weird thing to do during a first kiss. Why do the bats listen to Morbius and not Loxias? Is Morbius drinking real blood now? Because apparently it was on the verge of being useless, so he must have switched over from the fake stuff. If Morbius is drinking real blood now (as the movie explicitly set up to be his only option anymore), then why did he care so much that Loxias was doing the same?I could keep asking questions, but what's the point? I left Morbius genuinely wondering all of those things, but I don't think the writers were very interested in continuity or things making sense. The story is bad with a capital B, easily the worst part of the movie.4. Post credit scenes.What in the world was that??? Seriously, THAT'S the best you can do?!?!? I pray that whoever wrote the two post credits scenes never writes in Hollywood again, and I pray that whoever approved them never holds another job in the film industry. These two scenes are absolute garbage on so many levels! First of all, they are wildly inconsistent with the characters that they're portraying. Adrian Toomes is a man completely driven by his love for his family and his desire to take care of them, but when he suddenly blinks into another universe his only thought is \"I hope the food's better here\"???? Huh?!? And then Morbius himself, when he meets up with the Vulture in the desert he is just torally on board with teaming up with this random dude in a flight suit. Since when was Morbius a villain?? He tried to NOT kill the entire movie! Also, this was not as glaring of an issue during the film, but the editing in these two scenes is horrific. It's just a bunch of quick cuts stuffed together, and it comes across as extremely rushed and unsure of itself. Instead of making me excited for the multiversal crossover I was instead left with the feeling that the studio didn't really care about what was happening. If they felt so little confidence in these two characters why should I care about them myself?In the end, I know some people may disagree with my opnion and say they enjoyed this movie, and that's Ok. I praise anyone who can derive enjoyment from what I cannot, but I myself just could not get into this story no matter how hard I tried. I am usually very forgiving of movie mistakes and inconsistencies, but when it happens this much in one movie I can't ignore it. Overall, Morbius is easily the worst comic book movie of all time (Yes, I've seen Fan4stic) and on top of that, I'd say it's in contention for the worst movie I have ever seen! I hope some people out there can have fun with this movie, but I just can't find any reason to like this pile of garbage.",

I mean, there is no logical story or plot.Perhaps the director should not take the full responsibility. The corporation between Disney and Sony is pretty shaky recently, and this might disturb the filmmaking of this movie.I am not sure if Mobius is a hero or villain, or anti hero. I am not so sure what I watched. I usually stand in the neutral position to write film reviews, but this movie's negativity is too much that I could not find anything positive to write about. I also do mind that if miss any details when I watch movies in the theaters and I rather to hold my piss, but halfway through the film, I was like, nah, I know what is gonna happen, let me take a break and do the number 1 and come back, I am not going to miss anything anyway.",

    "text": "There's just a few things I don't understand about superhero movies, some sort of \"Hollywood rules\" the first one being why does it always need the complete origin story? Think back to the X-Men, what made those movies so great? No origin stories, except for the movies they made that where especially for that. There they where, just being superheroes. Why not do the origin like a short flashback sorta montage like they often do in the comics? Second off you take Venom and Venom 2 even, they're always up to someone with the exact same identical powers. Why? I have no earthly idea. Part of what makes the hero so special is that he has these powers, put him up against any of the million villains Marvel has, make it otherwise challenging for the hero by having a very specific villain with a power thats hard for them to beat and they need to use their wits. If it had been up to me I would have made this another Spider-man movie and set Morbius up against him, it would have made it so much more interesting since Morbius technically isn't a villain but due to his ailment acts like one. Those where always the most amazing Spidey stories. I also feel Morbius as a character just doesn't have what it takes to carry an entire movie, and this is proof of that. Not due to Jared Leto's acting mind you, which was great as always he gave it his absolute best.For the ridiculous 3 years wait i'd have to say I expected so much more. I wish I could give this movie a rave review but i'm sorry, I just can't.",

    "rating": 4,
    "date": "2022-05-12",
    "text": "Sony doesn't really have anything on Disney/Marvel's MCU level that they can leverage into a legitimate expanded universe, but what they do have, for the most part, is Spider-Man, and apparently all the characters that exist in the Spider-Man comics. Armed with that information and fresh off the success of both the Tom Holland Spider flicks (which are sort of MCU/Sony hybrids) and 'Venom' Sony is attempting to establish a live action Spider-verse expanded universe. With that Jared Leto takes up the lead role in 'Morbius' who is a vampire and, I believe, a Spider-Man antagonist. I will admit to not having an extreme depth of knowledge in the lore and lineage of Spider-Man's rogues gallery therefore I can only confine my thoughts to what Sony actually put on screen. Daniel Espinosa, who previoiusly directed the film 'Life', was tapped to helm after Sony failed to convince Antoine Fuqua or F. Gary Gray to direct. Jared Leto appears in the lead role with prominent supporting roles going to Matt Smith, Jared Harris and Adria Arjona. This fits solidly into the origin story superhero genre.We are introduced to a 10 year old Michael Morbius who has an incurable blood disease and is living in a hospital/orphanage in Greece. He goes through friends at such a high rate that he just takes to calling them Milo. The latest Milo, actually Lucien, sticks around a while and becomes Michael's lifelong friend, played as an adult by Matt Smith. The hospital director Nicholas, played by Jared Harris, becomes a proxy father to them both. Michael is brilliant and invents a synthetic blood that changes the world and even wins him a Nobel prize. He is driven on a quest to cure his and thereby his friend Milo's disease. This leads him to some very risky propositions in an effort to push medicine forward before he succumbs. He captures a bunch of very specific vampire bats in Costa Rica and eventually has success splicing their genes along with that of a humans which he thinks will cure him. He uses himself as a guinea pig and the results, as you can plainly see, cause him to become a vampire. He realizes that while this \"cure\" gives him superhuman abilities it comes with a desire for blood. Conveniently the synthetic blood can stop him from feasting on humans, but soon humans around him start dying, drained of blood and he is wondering if his vampire alter ego is taking control. Come to find out his bestie, without the moral qualms of a doctor, has filched this serum and is rampaging as an unabashed bloodsucker loving his new found power, and it is up to Morbius to stop him before it is too late.This film was widely panned by both fans and critics. I did not hate the general concept and I thought the special effects were decent despite some trashing them. They were much better than I thought they would be. The problem is you're taking an antagonist who is a vampire, which is antithetical to being human and a doctor, and you are devising a way to keep him as the good guy rather than treating him as a bad guy or even as an antihero. Really this film wants him to be a genuine hero attempting to make a lot of right decisions in a situation that is nothing but wrong. Like I said not knowing anything about the character I do not know how the comic book handles any of this, and honestly I don't really care to delve into it so I am uncertain on whether or not he is just a Spider-Man bad guy or an antihero of some sort or some other cross-pollination of these concepts. Here though what they try to do with him fails to some degree. Really, more than the failure of Leto's Morbius, is the complete bungling of the film's antagonist role. Matt Smith is set up as the best friend who caves in to his inner bestial mentality when he takes the serum and becomes a vampire now setting him up at odds with his life long friend. There was a miniscule attempt to set this up, however, it is completely foreseeable from predicable plot standpoint. It was so incredibly basic and lazy storytelling and, to me, it is the movie's greatest flaw. While many call this movie complete trash I would not go that far. I think there is some mild entertainment here to be had, but the movie is still far from good, and while it attempts to set up future films in this Sony Spider-verse world I find it hard to believe, given the generally negative reception, that this character, or at least Leto's version of it, will be featured in any future projects.Eric's Grade: C-",

It was fine, but it was a lot of slow motion or too fast moving camera's to know what was going oni also thought that we had an ending to this film set up, and they completely disregarded what was set up and the film just ended after Milo was killed.Michael Keaton was a huge disappointment in the film and i'm not excited whatsoever for the sinister six set up.The post credit scenes (there are two) are garbage and the script was awful in them.All in all, there are bits and pieces that you can enjoy about the film but i would never watch this film again.",

    "text": "So I watched Morbius out of curiosity, I've never cared much about the character when reading comics but it left me wondering if the writers actively hated the character.His origin was quick and simple enough, rare condition, needs replacement blood three times a day. Okay it's ludicrous, but whatever sets the premise. Revealing that he's a gigantic douchebag early on doesn't help me sympathize with him. Why is he such a douchebag? Because not only does he refuse a nobel prize (which would have only helped his cause and paid for his research) but he insists on calling Lucien 'Milo' like a jerk, reminding his supposed friend that Lucien is just filling another person's space until he dies and a new Milo comes in. That's cold enough, but worse - EVERYONE calls Lucien 'Milo' for the rest of the movie, including Dr. Nicholas. No wonder Lucien goes the villain route right outta the gate.So after refusing the Nobel and the million dollar prize, the now desperate Michael Morbius goes the mad science route and conducts illegal experiments in international waters where after nearly 200 failures he creates a 'cure' which goes wrong. Naturally this happens - it's a comic book movie.Moving on.For some reason the DNA of vampire bats gives him blood thirst, super strength, speed and a vapor trail... Oh yeah and has super hearing (the really kooky kind that lets him pick out a single voice or even a heartbeat in a city of millions) and can fly along on sound waves... you know... like a bat... The vapor trail thing bothered me from the beginning, it seemed to be associated with sound but in a weird way since it didn't move like sound wave but acted more like smoke. It seems to exist solely to look cool in a trailer.Lucien/Milo stumbles onto Morbius and sees what he's done to himself and immediately decides 'I want me some of that gruesome and painful looking cure!'. I get that he sees any chance as being better than his current state, but wow. Maybe he should have waited a day or two to see how turning into a blood sucking monster worked out before signing up for the early access?I won't bother the many many factual errors since that would take too long. Instead I'll complain about how Morbius gripes about not wanting to drink human blood despite the fact that donated blood works just fine as does drinking from the dead (which he does).Oh and in the end it turns out he can summon bats too, you know because he can yell...The symbolism is a bit in-your-face, although not Catwoman levels, but still things like all the red/green stuff including Milo murdering Martine on a skylight divided into the colors, and 'staking' Lucien/Milo with the vampire killing syringe in the heart.Then there was the 'turning' shot at the end which begs the question, how many more of Lucian's victims will be blood crazed vampires by morning? Also can the bitten turn others? If so the city should be 50% vampire in about a week.If the writers had decided to go with a more supernatural theme instead of trying to make this into mad science horror film, it would have at least made all the powers make a bit more sense or at least seemed less arbitrary.A few other things that bothered me were the various cribs from other movies. Some were obvious like the line from The Incredible Hulk, the recreation of the mercs/military being stalked from the same movie, and the Batman/Venom joke. While others are less so, such as the notes from 'Dies Irae' to emulate the Batman Begins theme when Morbius steps into the chamber of bats and Lucien/Milo acting like Kiefer Sutherland's David character from the Lost Boys, while dressing like Stanley Ipkiss in the Mask...Anyway then we get to the post credits -\nWTF? Why is Toomes in the Sony 'Stuff That is Sort Of Related to the Spider-Verse' now? If it's because he knew Peter Parker is Spider-man then why isn't MJ, Ned, and most of NYC there too? Where did he get a new Vulture suit? The Tinkerer built all his stuff in Homecoming using stolen alien tech which doesn't exist in this reality Toomes had no idea how to build it. Also is he wanting to hunt Spider-man now? Or is he trying to form a Thunderbolts kind of thing with people who morally gray? The Homecoming Vulture was just trying to make money and didn't want unnecessary violence or to call attention to himself.Something tells me we are unlikely to get any answers from the first Marvel (not MCU) movie to flop twice at the box office.",

    "text": "Morbius is a film. Such a awkward and disjointed flim it is, it'll make you wish we never got the CBM boom of the early 2010s.Everything about this movie sucks. The casting is generic. An extreme blue color grade for no reason! A script full of cliches and blurbs that somehow makes vampires look uncool. Frantic and disorienting cinematography that makes you wonder what is even happening.Jared Leto drags this bloating corpse of a movie across the finish line from start to finish. You did a great job.\"From an aesthetic perspective, he fits the bill. A meek, sickly Doctor with a bad boy side. Unfortunately, as soon as he opens his mouth, it all flies out of the window. Adria Arjona does a decent job portraying the kind, intelligent Martine Bancroft but she's there so someone can tell Morbius about how he needs to, \"keep his humanity\" and that \"this isn't him.\" Matt Smith outright should not have been cast in this movie. His acting comes off as more parody than theatrical. Add in the questionable design choices of the CGI and a lot of scenes are uncomfortable to watch.This movie lacks depth on all fronts and is a mess in the same way a dumpster fire or a traffic collision is. A terrible event that is impossible to look away from. The ending and final fight scene happens with little fanfare. Plagued by the problems I mentioned earlier, it is microcosm for the entire movie. It comes and goes before you know it, leaving you asking, \"That was it?.\"It signals in some way, the end of CBM's reign of terror over the movie industry. It tries to do everything films like Endgame, Infinity War & Far From Home achieved, yet accomplishes nothing. It is an historical flop of a movie.The only reason to watch it is to say you were there when this all happened.",

The problem is that when you look at the budget, you realize that it could have been a decent movie if only they put the smallest of effort into the script and production, however, they did not.Every scene feels empty and cliche beyond comprehension. The performances are pretty bad, and the main characters do not have any proper arks. The villain literally does not have any motivation; he's just being horrible only because he can, which begs the question; why did Morbius not realize that his friend is a terrible person before?Also, Morbius kills 20 guys in the beginning and then pretends that he is still a good guy. We are supposed to be ok with it because the movie literally tell us that they were \"bad guys\", and we're supposed to just accept that.",

    "text": "You should believe the reviews.Unlike the new Batman, where from the very first scene I was hooked and stayed that way through the whole thing, (And it was long. People said it was boring and dragged on, but this felt 100% longer and it was only 103 minutes I believe) with this movie by the half hour mark I was hoping it would end soon.The beginning absolutely sails through the introductions, with the first scene being a CGI helicopter landing on a CGI ledge with CGI water flowing into a CGI cave. Jared Leto gets out of the helicopter, cuts his hand open and bats fly and attach themselves to him right away.... Then it cuts to him and his friend as children in a hospital a long time ago, and within a single introductory conversation switches between several different locations of them sitting around and doing different things in different times/places having the same conversation. Then it switches to Jared Leto becoming a doctor, and then him working in a hospital, and then him coming up with a cure for his disease, explaining how he's doing it and then the trial is successful and he has a cure! Let me remind you, this is all the very beginning of the movie... 'rushed' isn't even the correct word. At this point the script was nothing but keywords.I had issues with no one being able to really describe the movie, and now I understand why; there's nothing to talk about. Things just become the way they are with no proper explanation.A perfect example and probably the only one you'll need: Tyrese Gibson is chasing Leto through a 20-something story building. The center of the building is open so Leto FLIES to the roof of the building, leaving Tyrese on the bottom floor. He gets to the top and almost falls over the edge, and who is up there with him?! TYRESE GIBSON. My husband and I said, maybe he's a vampire too??No! No he isn't! The movie ends with no purpose to him whatsoever and he is most definitely not a vampire and could not possibly find a bullet-train elevator to reach the top of the building at the same speed as someone who FLEW! (If there is an explanation for this please forgive me)And then there's the \"best friend forever\" Milo. These two sat in the park together and had one conversation and we're expected to believe they have this unbreakable bond. Jared Leto takes the serum he designed on a ship in the middle of the ocean with many procedures in place to cure himself, (and ends up diving off the ship after he murders everyone and swimming all the way back to his hospital on the mainland like he's also a vampire speed-boat, apparently?) and yet his friend Milo somehow gets ahold of his serum and injects himself with it and becomes super powerful all behind the scenes with absolutely no explanation. From then on he spends the rest of the movie harassing Leto into \"joining him\"....to which Leto just keeps trying to ditch him like an annoying younger brother. Either that or they activity try to kill each other multiple times. You know, like best friends always do! Oh well. It doesn't hurt their feelings at all. In fact, nothing much does. Who is Milo anyway? Just some dude with a disease, no matter...And through all this and without anything to do in the movie, the elderly doctor who helped them as young children remains the same age even though the children grow into men in their mid-thirties. He's also not a vampire, mind you. He just does a lot of Pilates to stay young, probably...There's so much to talk about. I feel like I need a drink, a nap and something good to watch. So yes, believe the reviews. It is actually not good. But if you enjoy it, please enjoy it without shame.",

    "text": "I had high hopes for Morbius ever since I first heard news of his movie being in development. This had so much potential to be better than what it turned out to be. Michael Morbius suffering from a debilitating disease that is slowly killing him and his friend, Lucian. He desperately experiments and searches for a cure leading him to test vampire bats before a test on himself goes wrong and becomes a living vampire. Come on! There so much potential and depth this movie had but the writers and director just barely did the bare minimumThe plot is flat. None of the characters are fully developed nor engaging. It just showed surface levels of Morbius's struggle and coming to terms with being a vampire. His friendship turned enemy with Lucian literally had no depth or meaning. Lucian as a character is just awful. There's no personality or depth to him. All he was was a friend turned enemy after stealing Morbius's vampire serum. Cheesy one dimensional villain stuff when it comes to Lucian's goals. There were even moments during the plot it felt very predictableIn all honesty this movie needed two hours to have proper development for not only the plot to flow better but to have Morbius, Lucian and Morbius's love interest to be fleshed out and developed to the point where you had feelings and cared for themNow comes the part with the mid credit scenes with Michael Keaton as Vulture stumbling into Venom and Morbius's universe after the events of No Way Home with the multiverse and Dr Strange putting it back together again. Although I can see some issues people had like Vulture suddenly getting his suit from out of nowhere and teaming up with Morbius to take on that universe's Spider-Man whoever that will be. Although neither of those characters have ever crossed that Spider-Man, certainly not Vulture as he used to be in the MCU. The scene of him meeting and forming an alliance with Morbius was obviously intended to set up a future Sinister Six movie. Im sure other than that, there's a good reason for Vulture suddenly appearing in that universe which will be revealed in timeOverall, this movie should have been a smash hit and have been so much better than what it turned out to be which was a complete disappointment. What a shame.",

It is easily one of, if not one of the movies of all time. It goes against cinematic norms, and decides that it is going to take a leap of faith and not stick to a script and improvise on the spot and because of that we have a truly morbtacular film. 10000 morbillion out of 10 when he said \"it's morbin' time\" I morbed all over the theater in excitement. The fact Morbius gives its fans their own empty theater, to immerse them in the Morbverse and make you feel like the man himself is morbmazing. I didn't watch Morbius, I listened.

This movie is a fun, thrilling and at times pretty scary addition to the marvel universe. Jared Leto is surprisingly good in this role and I'm optimistic about how Morbius will be integrated in a larger Spider-Man story. The poor critical appraisals are reminiscent of Venom, which did very well at the box office and has many fans. I actually loved this movie and can't wait for a sequel. I'd wager 90% of the hate being spread on the internet is coming from people who haven't even seen the movie. Overall a fantastic introduction to a fascinating character. The 2 mid-credits scenes were very unexpected and affects the long term box office viability for the SSU. What I do find interesting is the multiverse implications and whether or not Andrew Garfield will be the SSU's Spider-Man, facing off against Tom Hardy's Venom/the sinister 6. The formation of the latter was hinted at in the mid credit scenes of Morbius. While there clearly seems to have been some production/editing/delay issues, it didn't feel like a soulless cash grab, at least to me. There does seem to be a larger payoff that's being built towards, which is cool. Now that a larger Spider-Man story has been alluded to, the interconnectedness of the movies will drive Spider-Man fans to see every release regardless of the criticism, similar to the MCU.",

    "text": "I give this movie a 6 because it was entertaining, although it was very underwhelming compared to what I was hoping for this movie. I went to see it hoping to see a grounded take on the anti-hero, but it was another generic popcorn flick by Sony, in the same style of their Venom films of course.I liked Jared Leto's performance and he was a cool character, but it wasn't an original approach to the story. I actually was expecting some Spider-Man connections and references to whatever universe, and The Vulture being part of more scenes in the movie, but most of it was just cut or added to the mid-credits scene.Still, it's not a bad movie per se, just a mindless and generic film of the bunch from Sony. I would recommend to anyone who likes dark-toned movies or vampire stuff, just don't expect a solid film.",

I can understand that he wouldn't care for other people's life if it meant that he could be healthy and strong for the first time in his life, but why would he ever go against his best friend? We never see him having a resentment before that point.\"Killing\" two major characters in the span of 5-10 minutes wasn't a great choice either,and Martine only served as a damsel in distress.The final action sequence wasn't that great, but not because of visual effects, those were great, the problem was that we were very confused on why it was happening in the first place.Finally, I sincerely hope that the mid and post credits scenes won't lead anywhere, because I am not excited at all to see a Vulture-morbius collaboration, Morbius was good all this movie, why would he attack a guy he doesn't know in another dimension??",

    "text": "Felt like Jared Leto absolutely nailed the character. This movie was far more enjoyable than I thought it would be. The CGI and choreography were top notch and I LOVED how smoothly the slow mo scenes were done. I noticed Milo's vampire form had basically the same streaks as MCU's quicksilver. Also, the post credit scene is clearly a sinister six tease. Keaton's vulture was shifted by Dr. Strange's spell into Morbius' universe for a hearing that could lead to him being released.This movie also spiritually felt like a vampire version of the Incredible Hulk (2008). Loved that movie as well. Detailed list on why this movie is exactly like the incredible hulk (2008):Protagonists that are both doctors trying to find a cure and end up botching it and permanently transforming themselves.The typical \"there's a monster inside of me and I want it gone\" trope with the usual Dr. Hyde and Mr. Jekyll theme.The protagonist's love dynamic is more or less the same. The classic \"I love you but because of this thing inside me I have to leave before it acts out\" trope.First transformation fight scene involved fodder guys with guns and flashlights in a dimly lit factory with smoke everywhere so you can barely see morbius/hulk. This adds an element of fear and surprise.The watch connection. In the hulk movie Norton's Banner kept a watch on him 24/7 to monitor his heart rate. In Morbius, Dr Morbius kept a watch on him 24/7 to monitor the time before he would start craving blood.The protagonists want to commit suicide to rid themselves of the monster inside of them.Lots Of Chase Scenes.Hooded protagonist hiding out from people.LE was constantly after the protagonist.Main antagonist is an evil copycat of the protagonist that abused the same serum they used in an attempt to replicate their transformation.Main protagonist frames the main protagonist for damage done and people mix them up.Morbius literally referenced the hulk at one point. \"You won't like me when I'm hungry\",",

Anyway after they show us the past we turn back to the present WITHOUT a notice, they didn't even put an effort on that. The movie continues to be problematic and the best part is his friend who wants the cure but Michael told him it's a curse not a solution to the problem, turns evil and he tries to kill Michael and blah blah we don't care, after the fight they movie finish SO BAD that i thought maybe they cutted scenes, unfortunately not.Really 0 effort.

It was just one cut scene after another. No character development, despite the bleak effort in the beginning. And the effects were only good if a character was standing still. I had to guess what I thought the powers were for the floating color waves based off of my own knowledge of where storytellers go with science fiction most times. And the ending was so quick and effortless that I still didn't care by the time the story got there. And the 2 end credit scenes made no sense in the grand scheme of what Sony has been trying to build alongside Marvel. Yeah, sure you can find a fan theory on some Reddit style waste of time blog but why do I have to keep doing that with this Sony/Marvel crap? I haven't read the comics. But I shouldn't have to read comics to go see a movie. I didn't have to with any other comic book based movie. So that's not a good excuse for me to not understand what the hell they were trying to do here.But like I said, I absolutely love Jared Leto. And I'm a fan of some gruesome vampire tales. So I was so freaking excited for this movie ever since it was announced. But I walked out of this movie speechless. Mainly disappointed.",

    "text": "Morbius is directed by Daniel Espinosa.It stars Jared Leto, Matt Smith, Adria Arjona, Jared Harris, Tyrese Gibson and Al Madrigal.In this new marvel film, \"Doctor Michael Morbius\" and his friend \"Loxias Crown\" are suffering from a rare blood disease. With time running out, Michael finds what he thinks is a cure but It ultimately inserts a living vampire into his body which has an urge to consume blood. Michael must find a way to live with the vampire while also trying to help \"Loxias\" from inserting his own vampire.So, this has been released 2 years after It's original release date and no one was really asking for it. But I love the marvel universe so of course I was going to see this. I wasn't really excited but I like to give every film I see a fair chance. I don't think many will be surprised when I say this film was bad. Really bad.The positivesThe performances are overall very good. Jared Leto does well as Morbius. He doesn't play anything special but he's very good with what he's given. Matt Smith as Loxias Crown was really over the top and I loved It. The movie hopes you take his character seriously but you can't because Matt Smith is just not giving a damn and playing the character how he wants to. He was really entertaining and quite charming. Adria Arjona was ok as-well. I didn't really care for her characters romance with Michael but her performance is really good. I like the design of Morbius In this film. It looks creepy and Is quite faithful to the design in the comics. The makeup artists did a very good job with the design. There was one good horror scene. It had a good build up but the ending of that scene was so clich\u00e9.The negativesThis movie is so predictable. It's cliche and your bored until the post credits. After watching the first five minutes of the film, I knew exactly what was going to happen but I still watched just to give the film a chance. The villain's motivation has been used countless times in film and I'm getting bored of it. After, Loxias gets the vampire, I checked out because i knew exactly what would happen. Bu Matt Smith is loving his time, he's so over the top. Another big problem with the film was It's trailer. A' lot of things that were in the trailer were not in the film. Remember seeing that Spider-Man painting on the wall. Well I hope you had zero hope of it appearing in the film because It never shows up. Remember seeing Adrian Toomes In the trailer. Well prepared to be disappointed as he's in the film for about a minute. I hate when studios oversell things with their trailers. They tricked you into thinking that Vulture would be in the movie for a good period of time and they tricked you into thinking that Spider-Man could appear. It's so offensive to your audience. The action In this film Is so boring. They kept doing that slow-Mo then fast sort of editing. It was good back when the film \"300\" came out but It's being milked to death and I just want to see something new with the editing. The action scenes are CGI cluster bombs. Some of the CGI is so bad. You can see green screen outlines around the actors and the digital models flop around like they have no muscle and bone. The character's have so little development as-well. Some are underused such Morbius's mentor and Martine Bancroft. This film is pretty much here to set up future films. Not to tell a compelling story. I really hope Sony Improves on there Marvel universe because I'm starting to want Spider-Man properties to go back to Marvel.ConclusionMorbius Is terrible. Some good performances, one scary scene and a good character design. But with a misleading trailer, terrible action, terrible characters, atrocious CGI and no attempt to create a compelling story. Morbius Is predictable and has so many clich\u00e9's that you forget about this film after 5 minutes of seeing it.I'm going to give Morbius a:2/10.",

Could have made better choices in several areas of the movie.The biggest was probably the too earlier of a reveal of what Morbius was underneath. They should have done it classic. Show him struggle after the serum but come out of it like the experiment was a success. Having him discover his powers along the way and possibly might want to use them for good until the artificial blood didnt work and the beast inside started to take over. Having Matt Smith all of a sudden know where the serum was in the lab when he was only in there a short amount of time and didnt really understand what was going on.That was the biggest problem. Too rushed and missed opportunities with character development and story. The SFX in the movie werent great, they should have come up with better way of showing his powers that must make it a trailing blur. Needed to stretch it out and make better decisions, could have been a good one.Gave it a 5 because I have seen worse. They can maybe reinvent the character when the Blade movie comes around.",

The story line jumps and bumps from one point to another fast enough.2. The number of characters in this movie are not that much, but somehow the development of the characters is that bad.3. The story line is pretty basic : a person who turns into monster, and has to fight the villain who gets the benefit from his own formula, so I pretty much can guess how the movie would end.4. In the credit scene, it is very unclear why Morbius hates spiderman and decides to join with Vulture. They don't explain that throughout the movie.Plus :\n1. The choreograph is fantastic, I love the fighting scenes in this movie.2. The CGI effects are also incredible, I enjoy it so much : the echo location, the effect when Morbius and Milo moves, the physical changing when they turn into vampiric monsters, etc3. Matt Smith (Milo) acting is really good.Overall, it is an Okay movie, with bad script but good choreo & CGI. Still an enjoyable movie for me to watch on weekends or holidays, but maybe for hard fans of Marvel who consider character development is a huge important part of the movies, this movie is a big minus.",

The creators behind it tried too hard and absurdly butchered all the superheroes. On top of that, if you want to try to bring horrifying experience, please don't turn it into a silly comedy.

The plot its pretty classic : a normal guy who become a bad guy without the intention to be someone like this . And yeah there is the woman who can calm down the vampire and the vilain who will used the power in a bad way and will also torture the girl of the hero : i mean nothing new at the horizon. Like i said the special effects were really pretty good and give the movie a nice experience . But thats all really . Pretty disappointing in some way even if i enjoyed watch it . It was pretty classic marvel movie.",

A third rate Spider-Man character in a movie that doesn't have Spider-Man and stars Jared Leto, Tyrese Gibson (with a pretty robotic arm if the trailer was to be believed) and the guy who probably regrets leaving Dr Who more than any actor who ever played Dr Who. Well, first things first... there is no robotic arm. I mean there might be but, we never see it and nobody ever mentions it. Morbius is kind of played like a \"is he good or is he bad\" type of deal but its resolved within minutes. I zoned out for a bit and Matt Smith was a vampire too but a vampire that still wears Reebok classics in 2022 so definitely not like a cool vampire. Theres some painfully tagged on mid/post credit sequences but honestly just avoid it. If we stop paying to watch these crap movies Tom Rothman over at Sony might stop greenlighting them. Maybe he'll retire and Sony can start making better films, like Fox did when he left that studio.",

The writing is broken (things just happen with no explanation or no purpose), the editing is awful where you can tell that scenes are missing (Matt smith just becomes a vampire and a murderous psychopath off screen), the visual effects look like the early 2000s superhero movies, the action is atrocious (ruined by bad cgi, horrible camera work, and no sense of tension), the acting is terrible (Jared Leto and tyrese Gibson look bored, jarred Harris is wasted, and Matt smith just overacts but not in a fun way), the music is either generic or rips off batman begins, for a vampire movie it is surprisingly tame and censored (either no blood or color corrected to look black instead of red even in broad light), and the post credits scenes are the worst in history that make no sense with how vulture would be teleported to the Sony verse, where he got his suit, how he found Morbius, why he would find Morbius interesting, why Morbius would be interested in anything vulture says to him?

    "text": "Nowadays, I can count three different targets in the audience that goes to watch a Marvel movie. Those who are interested mainly in the Disney ones, those who are interested mainly in the Sony ones, and finally, those who are interested just in having a good time at the theater. This review is for the second and the third group of people. Mainly for the third one.I am a superhero comic book reader since I was a kid, specially a Spider-Man and Venom enthusiast. There are many things I can breakdown from this movie, but first and foremost, I have to thank Sony for bringing this character I fell in loved with in the Animated show from the 90's to life for the first time.The movie starts giving us an idea about who Michael Morbius is. And that is a science genius. How do I know? Not just because they wanted to give him the Nobel prize, or because he fixed Milo's machine when it was about to collapse in a second. It's because he is a risky guy. He takes the risk and success. He is so sure about his premises and goes all-in with them. He takes the risks because he is going to die soon and his intelligence is the only thing that he has left. That is something that the woman that works with him everyday feels attractive. So attractive that she is all commited to a man who can barely walk. How do I know it is attractive for her? Because it is for me.But before his experiment went wrong, Michael made another mistake. As a child. He decided to put himself in a place that didn't really belong to him. He renamed Lucien. He put himself on top of him. And Lucien allowed it. Because of one thing. Michael promised him results. So then it came the disappointment. Lucien put all his faith in Michael blindly with all his will and resources just to get disappointed. So he couldn't tolerate it. And he embraced the experiment regardless it was mistaken.I guess the whole movie is about this. A friendship. Idolizing friends and being disappointed by them. With this, there are many other subtleties that makes total sense within the movie.About the director, he delivers a poweful job, with psichodelic themes, a bit of horror sometimes and quite shocking results.Jared Leto does fantastic with him and the CGI vampire providing Jeykill and Hyde thrilling moments. Matt Smith is superb. Adria fits perfectly and Jared Harris is such a moving character.At the end of the day, all I can say is, this is a beyond satisfyed customer talking and that I feel ashamed of that evil mob in the internet ingniting the social media recently... What a nuisance.",

    "title": "Vampires Suck",
    "rating": 2,
    "date": "2022-04-10",
    "text": "Potential Spoilers AheadOkay no, Vampires don't suck. It's just that this specific vampire movie isn't very good.It's a shame too as I was curious about how this would turn out. Dr. Michael Morbius isn't a very well known character within the Spider-man universe but as Iron Man and Guardians of the Galaxy proved, great movies can turn previously unknown characters into icons. Taking away the comic book connection, a movie where a doctor slowly becomes a vampire and has to reconcile his human side with his growing desire for blood could have made for a good character study mixed with violent action...even if it was PG-13.Unfortunately we didn't get that movie. What we got was a boring and predictable mess that squanders any potential the story had. Reviews of Morbius have universally described it as one of the worst comic book movies to have been released in recent times. Yes, it's bad but it just feels so forgettable that it doesn't seem worth raging over. In some ways, that might be worse than a movie that is so bad it's maddening.Maybe that's why the characters-whatever it be Morbius or any of the side characters-feel stale. They feel like they're just there to make the plot happen instead of providing any sort of engagement. As a result, any sort of emotional engagement to them is about as lifeless as Morbius's victims. For example, an important character that has emotional attachment to Morbius is killed. It's supposed to be an emotional moment but since the script doesn't allow the audience to get to know that character, it feels hollow and forced.As for the acting, I do feel sorry for Jared Leto here. He has been in a lot of good movies (Fight Club, Requiem for a Dream, American Psycho, Dallas Buyers Club) but between this and Suicide Squad, he may have just cemented his reputation as comic book movie poison. It's not that he's awful as Morbius, he's just doing the wrong performance for the wrong movie. Throughout the film, he goes for a very dry and subdued performance that doesn't change (except for a couple of scenes). That might have worked in a different movie but here, it comes across as robotic and as a result, he is unfortunately uninteresting compared to the main villain.Speaking of the villain, Matt Smith plays him and to his credit, he really looks like he's having a lot of fun. Whenever he shows up on screen, he provides the movie with at least some burst of needed energy. There's even a couple of moments that reminded me of his role as the 11th Doctor. It's unfortunate that the character Smith plays is badly written. He starts out as an important ally to Morbius before abruptly turning evil and deciding to murder everyone as well as toy with Morbius. The movie does try to explain what might have sent him down such a dark path through flashbacks and interactions with Morbius but it's not explained in a way that could give this character any nuance.But what really drags the movie is the story and the action scenes. A lot of people that I've heard said the story was confusing. While I didn't have that problem, the main flaw for me (and for many others I'm sure) was that once the story was at a certain point, you could tell exactly how things were going to unfold. The movie as a whole feels like a gigantic conveyor belt of cliches and scenes stolen from other superhero movies. There's a scene where Morbius steps inside a chamber filled with CGI bats and he raises up his hand to touch them to signify he's beginning to get in touch with his vampire side, but the scene overall feels like it was ripped off from Batman Begins. As for the other cliches...Does our protagonist have a heartfelt talk with his love interest on a rooftop (and later kisses her)? Yes\nIs the father-figure/mentor killed off to increase the drama? Yes\nIs the protagonist warned/warns other people that the dangerous power that now exists can't be controlled? Yes\nIs the love interest attacked/murdered to motivate the protagonist? Yes\nIs the villain what the hero (or anti-hero) might become if he loses all morality? Yes\nDoes the villain want the hero to embrace his monstrous side and join him? Yes\nIs there a chaotic fight scene at the climax where you can barely tell what's happening? Yes\nDoes the main character fly off at the end, leaving the city and home he loves to explore his abilities? YesReally if you've seen any superhero movie (or any blockbuster) you've seen Morbius.As for the fight scenes, they feel like something from the early 2000s and not in a good way. Everything Jared Leto leaps into air, he ends up looking like a bad special effect from a video game which is made even worse as almost every time he jumps or punches someone, smoke and air particles constantly fill the screen and the camera goes into slow motion only to speed up again. Coupled with the frenetic speed the camera moves at during those scenes, the movie's action is reduced to an incoherent mess with bad effects.Bottom line, Morbius is a good idea ruined by uninteresting characters, a stupid story, and really awful action. It really does feel like what would happen if you took a bad early 2000s superhero movie and mixed it with a bad 2010s superhero movie. While not as unforgivably bad as 2004's Catwoman and 2015's Fantastic Four, it doesn't even have the \"So awful, it's hilarious\" curiosity of something like Batman and Robin. Meaning that this movie is one of those bad, forgettable movies that probably won't be remembered. I really do hope that Jared Leto pulls a Ryan Reynolds and gets to be in a good superhero movie because until he does, he will be seen as the actor unlucky enough to be in a bad DC movie and a bad Marvel movie.Rating: 2/10.",

The idea of injecting or merging human DNA with bat DNA doesn't turn you into a superhuman being with ultra sense of hearing.That's about it. Did i enjoy the movie? Well i would if i was 10 but i'm 20.",

    "text": "It was strangely exciting and suspenseful to watch \"Morbius\". Daniel Espinosa did crafty work on direction for this Marvel title. Story and screenplay by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless added to the strengths of this film - some witty and meaningful dialogues.The team made interesting use of creative license. I was not too fond of the pacing, it felt a bit rushed and disjointed. But, right from the start, they kept the tension taut and the storyline going. Many a scene relied on familiar tropes, though, which served to weaken the film's storytelling value.Jon Ekstrand's musical scoring ensured that the movie's 'nightmare quotient' stayed on point. Oliver Wood's cinematography made it feel at once realistic and immersive. Pietro Scalia's editing was good.Production design by Stefania Cella was noteworthy. The art direction and set decoration crews did great work. Cindy Evans pulled rabbits out of the costume design hat - or should I say, bats. Some great VFX work in \"Morbius' worth appreciating.They captured a few emotional 'origin story' elements and 'dark gothic' vibes in this movie. The film centred around Dr. Michael Morbius, played by Jared Leto. He brought a good sense of gravitas to his role, and not a small amount of urgency to his character's motives.Playing Milo was Matt Smith, who was great. Martine Bancroft was played by Adria Arjona who was quite good. Dr. Emil Nicholas, played by Jared Harris, was memorable. Agent Simon Stroud, played by Tyrese Gibson was good. Agent Rodriguez, played by Al Madrigal, was noteworthy. Adrian Toomes, cameod by Michael Keaton, was a treat - Toomes is The Vulture from the comic books.The story was quite straightforward, especially to fans of the comics created by Roy Thomas. Granted, his stories were much darker, which is why I found it odd that Marvel, not DC, originally got their hands on it.Speaking of, I believe \"Morbius\" did not enjoy too much success partly because it released just after \"The Batman\", and few titles can compare to that Matt Reeves masterpiece imo.I particularly liked the idea of 'artificial blood' used in \"Morbius\". However, given the ongoing covid-19 pandemic, it was hard to accept anyone experimenting on bats for whatever reason. Looks like 'real life' and 'reel life' both produce negative outcomes when people mess with those mammals. The underlying subtext of the movie was not appropriate either - one must exploit other living things for Science's gain, one must take that so-called risk.It was also somewhat strange that they let a doctor practice medicine though he himself was disabled. I'm not sure if such a thing is permitted in real life, but the character trait was needed for Dr. Morbius, I guess. He was also incredibly OP, which was not quite bat-like.\"Morbius\" 2022 was certainly over-hyped but it was not as bad as some critics and online opinions will have you believe, though. It had several memorable moments, noteworthy performances, great CGI (those lens splatters), amazing stunt choreography, and thrilling action sequences.However, a handful of scenes came across as disjointed or abrupt. The pace was too 'hop, skip, and jump'. I kinda liked the movie, but I believe it could've been better if they took it along a darker track and relied less on tropes, stereotypes, and clich\u00e9s.The final fight scene had some great moments, and both post-credits scenes held promise. A distinct \"Spider-Man\" bridge was formed, so here's hoping they give us a crossover.",

Martine learns the truth about Morbius and 5 minutes later she is making out with him.We never find out why Morbius turns down the Nobel prize.There seems to be no arc of how Morbius and Milo learn to control their powers.Why can Morbius control the bats but Milo can't?

I think that Morbius is a barely entertaining movie, the characters are quickly developed to get to the climax and there are no reasons for the main villain to be bad, actually, there's no build for Milo, he's bad because reasons. Not to mention that this is a movie about a villain itself, so this make me wonder if producing solo movies for them is as integrating as combining them with spider-man. This solo villains have no porpuse in their world and there's no real challenge for their feats. I had some issues with the last vampire transformation and how it happened too. I don't recommend this to my biutyful gf.",

Matt Smith got the jackpot playing Milo the main villain, in which he is clearly having a blast playing.Jared Leto played the main hero as a mild manner vampire doctor, weird balance of character but very common in American's comic book. Unfortunately, the main hero in comic books movie is usually very replaceable by any other actor.The weak point of the movie is the story flow. I felt like watching a cartoon movie. The director didn't take too risky storylines and developed further. Morbius is a very risky character but highly potential to break the tradition, but they took the safer route and that's how Morbius became less impressive and less memorable.Hopefully, they can expand their characters better, if there's a next film in the series for Sinister Six.",

It wasn't just generic and lifeless... it made no sense.Morbius makes serum and becomes a vampire. Kills nearly everyone on boat. We're suppose to be fine with this but we never developed hatred for the bad guys because they were never developed in any way.Now his best friend for life takes serum. He also kills but in his case, his killing is evil. Also, he wants to both force Morbius to accept his new powers and to kill his lifelong friend almost immediately. Why try to kill him?The rest is predictable storytelling: They fight, Morbius wins, the end.There were only 3 interesting things to come out of this film: (1) Morbius, (2) Michael Keaton (closing credit scene) and (3) The Bug Guy (?) at the end (the 2nd closing credit scene).I would see a Morbius part two because I think (I hope) they got the really bad character intro out of the way and the closing credit scenes promise more interesting storylines.",

Both Lucien and Morbius take the serum to save their lives. Morbius prevents Lucien to get the serum as he warns him. Morbius was asleep when Lucien took the serum inside Horizon Labs. Morbius fights Lucien and Martine played by Adria Arjona is the assistant was kill by Lucien and Morbius revives her turning her into a vampire. Adrian Toomes appears in mid credit scene for the reshoots that is transported to Sony-Marvelverse recruiting Michael Morbius to fight Spider-Man. But Tom Holland Spider-Man is not in this universe. There were references to Vlad Dracula the Lord of Vampires. And vampirism. Will see what happens next?",

    "text": "The film is a mess and disappointing.I wasn't a fan of both Venom films but they were better made than Morbius is. Venom and Morbius are Spiderman villains in the comic books. However, the studio wants to make these Spiderman villain into anti-heroes in their own movies teasing the fans hoping to see these characters interact with Spiderman or fight him in a later film. Morbius reminded me of the movie Wolf starring Jack Nicholson. That film was better than this one. Morbius was supposed to come out summer of 2020 and was moved as many times as Top Gun 2 was moved. And in that time period, the studio couldn't correct any mistakes with this film? I understand why fan feel mislead by the movie.In all the trailers there are scenes involving mentions of Spiderman, Spiderverse, and MCU and those scenes are not in the actual film. Fans feel duped. I hate when studios use deleted scenes in trailers.There are 2 bonus scenes in the middle of the end credits and those scenes show a connection to Spiderman, Spiderverse, and MCU. One of those scenes, the 2nd one has a flaw to it. It is possible that Dr. Strange 2 or another Marvel film could explain or correct the flaw in that 2nd end credit scene.Jared Leto is very good in the film. That is the only positive about the film. The film is predictable. The special effects are horrible. The editing in the film is sloppy and choppy. The film needed a new director, a new editor, a new script, and new special effects team.",

There isn't much of a bond formed with the characters to even care about them. Everything moves quickly without giving you time to digest the story or get into it. Just felt like a movie created to show various movie effects or special effects. This just wasn't a good movie or character introduction of Morbius.His powers are never explained, he just gets them. Takes some blood from a bat and makes some sort concoction, injects it into a mouse and the mouse passes out. Then it comes back to life and it's \"Michael it worked\". Then Michael takes it and suddenly gets supernatural powers and superhuman abilities. Just like that. No explanation or any sort of logical reason explaining how, he just now has inhuman abilities. They just happen. He can suddenly fly, have super human strength, move superhumanly fast, dodge bullets, climb walls, have a sonar sense, hear from far away, and becomes a creepy looking creature occasionally without much of a transformation, just phases in and out of the vampire like monster form. All that from injecting himself with his randomly made bat blood and whatever mixture. And it happens in a matter of seconds. Guess I can just go mess with bat blood and get the same powers. Bats must have some secret mystical power within their DNA that Michael Morbius unlocks. Wish I knew.The story continues that way, as in, just stuff keeps happening without explanation. Just a bunch of events and suddenly it's the end leaving thinking \"what the hell was all that?\" If someone asked you to tell them what Morbius is, even after watching this, you'd have no idea. Just he becomes a vampire of sorts, but not a technical vampire. *Shrugs* I don't know.I really tried with this movie. I knew the bad rating and have seen all the rants on it. But I still wanted to just try for myself. This movie isn't good. Just a spectacle or display of movie special effects with no reason behind them.If you're looking for Morbius from the comics or looking for a good superhero film, or even a fun vampire movie, look elsewhere. You won't find it in this movie.",

This is not a bad movie like the reviewers would lead you to believe, it just lands among average quality during our current age of superhero films.The plot is pretty basic origin-story stuff and it plays out in a predictable way. However I found the relationship between Morbius and the antagonist to be surprisingly compelling amidst - slightly better than the \"I'm bad because I'm just bad\" antagonists of MCU phase 1. Yes, there's lots of CGI but I found the PG-13 level of action to be enjoyable nonetheless. I was not expecting a gorefest, nor should anyone - this needs to be a broadly marketable franchise. Jared Leto also gives a good performance with what simplicity he's given because well...he's a good actor.I will say that the tie-in to the Sony Spiderverse is a complete afterthought. The credits scenes were weak and stupid.All in all, it's a pretty average superhero flick that has good production value. I personally think Venom is only one point above this because of the surprising rom-com element between Venom and Eddie which was unique. I think the bigger question is not \"why was Morbius bad?\" but \"why was Morbius made?\". The answer is Sony wants that superhero money with its property so it is hitting copy-paste from MCU. So, I don't really expect anything groundbreaking. If it does happen, it'll be a nice surprise.",

Jared Leto has had 2 superhero movie failures one from DC and Marvel; Joker in Suicide Squad and now this one! Overall just watch this for Matt Smith's performance he's the scene-stealer of the movie and I'm giving this one a 5/10!!! ;)",

    "rating": 2,

    "text": "Directed by Daniel Espinosa. Starring Jared Leto as \"Dr. Michael Morbius\". \"Morbius\" has a rare blood disease. Something I can relate to him oh to well. As a kid he was sent to a make shift hospital specifically for kids with rare diseases. Where \"Dr. Emil Nicholas\" played by Jared Harris took care of him. Also as this make shift Hospital he met \"Milo\" played by Matt Smith. \"Milo\" also had this same rare blood disease. \"Milo\" and \"Morbius\" stayed best friends into adulthood.\"Morbius\" was extremely gifted and was a genius. He eventually made a synthetic blood that saves a ton of lives but his whole life he's been working to cure \"Milo\" and himself of this rare blood disease. They have a short life expectancy and are already on borrowed time.\"Milo\" is wealthy and into some black market things. He uses his resources to help fund \"Morbius\" medical work. In doing so \"Morbius\" uses \"Milo's\" resources to do an experiment with vampire bats he collected in Costa Rica.After testing himself on a ship in international waters which just happened to be a little out from Rhode Island with the help of \"Morbius\"colleague and fellow doctor \"Dr. Martine Bancroft\" played by Adria Arjona. There \"Morbius\" is turned into a vampire like creature. With the frail sickly man being long gone now with super human strength and bat like abilities. There is only one problem, he also has the urge for blood.After \"Milo\" who was warned not to take the serum takes it anyways now \"Morbius\" who's trying to check his cravings with the synthetic blood he created has to stop his best friend who's like a brother to him because \"Milo\" doesn't have the same control and wants to let his primal instincts take over. On top of all that \"Morbius\"has to try to stay away from two agents trying to track him down. \"Agent Simon Stroud\" played by Tyrese Gibson and \"Agent Rodriguez\" played by Al Madrigal.This film wasn't your normal bad film. In a sense of bad films it wasn't one, it was just ok. But as a comic book film it was terrible. This had the feeling like \"Justice league\" the Joss Whedon version gave you. Trying to catch up what should of been many films in one a team up film. That in Marvel place would of did throughout ten years. You can tell what films Marvel works with Sony and which ones they don't.This film plot was horrible. A lot of things seemed rushed and just thrown together. Even the main fight scene was very lackluster. While the trailer gave many scenes that weren't in this version of the film. I mean a scene from the trailer was a post credit scene. I've never seen that done before. Which they are two post credit scenes by the way. Sony is trying to attach its characters to the ground work Marvel has helped them with. And they're doing a poor job at.I'm more confused then anything. Sony and Marvel only work together on Spider-Man and that's a very fragile relationship. Now throw in Sony trying to attach \"Morbius\", \"Venom\", and a bunch more in a franchise that's been with Marvel and done right. \"Venom\" I'm intrigued with what they do in the future with him but after seeing \"Morbius\" I don't think they can handle what they're trying to pull off.Just because you hire A list actors to play these roles doesn't mean it will succeed. \"Morbius\" had great actors in it, that was given a horrible canvas to work with. I would of liked to see Tyrese Gibson character arm which looked robotic in the trailer. The agents were a after thought. They brought up \"Venom\" and \"Spider-Man\" in the film which also made no sense. You could see they were only bringing them up for future film references.Plot was horrible, story line was bad and like I said before it's a watchable film. But when it comes to comic book films is terrible. I have to give \"Morbius\" two mor fires \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25. I really hope Marvel and Sony can expand there relationship. With Spider-Man success Sony seems to have forgotten how they got that success and thinks it was all them. So expect more mid when it comes to the Sony owned Marvel property character films.#CosmoandtheMovieWithin\n#CosmoMovieBlog\n#CosmoLanier\n#Morbius.",

Leto really risked his health by doing that. Who knew eating people could make you so buff.Why the heck does the whole ships crew have guns, especially rifles in a confined space; it makes no sense.Tyrese Gibson, I loved him in Legion, does a very nice job. He has such a terrific voice. Cops asking questions concerning a capital crime without Miranda and an attorney, no way; it doesn't make sense.The CGI is very good, but, these guys are bouncing around the subway slamming into walls, breaking through glass! Clothes never get torn? It doesn't make sense.Adria Arjona, is as beautiful an actress as there is.EMT's leaving stuff on the street, who knew in a couple hours you could turn a funny money print shop into a medical lab in a couple hours (with no tools), a drop of Dr. Bancroft's blood from opening cat food nearly overwhelmed Morbius but seeing his friend Dr. Nicholas' didn't , Morbius can control the bats and Milo can't, none of this makes sense to me.This is my kind of movie, and after reading other reviews I was surprised how much I enjoyed it.",

    "text": "I enjoyed Morbius despite its very obvious editing flaws. First of all, I agree with the widespread opinion regarding the mid-credit scenes. They're very definitely confusing and felt like they were added because that's the \"thing to do\". They didn't really add anything and didn't leave me excited for the possibility of an upcoming movie.Second of all, what was the point of the very first scene? The movie opens to Morbius going to a bat cave, cutting his hand and letting the bats (I assume because you can't truly see) drink his blood. I thought we would revisit this scene at some later point in the movie, I figured it would contribute to his transformation but it didn't. It had no effect on the movie whatsoever.That right there was this movie's whole issue. Scenes that had no effect on the story were added while the majority of the movie had holes in the storytelling. It was almost like they took out scenes that they didn't think were important but they had a major role in the flow of the story. This movie is barely an hour and 45 minutes long but they could have easily added an additional 30 or 45 minutes to help with the flow of the story and Morbius' origin.Instead, we're left with a choppy film that feels very much thrown together at the last minute. With all the delays this movie had, you would think they would've taken the extra time to perfect it but it's obvious that wasn't done. On the plus side, IF the Morbius character gets a sequel they have nowhere to go but up. But, for the love of good movies, find a different director or editor or something! Someone who actually knows how to tell a good, smooth story.One more thing. Being a Whovian, I absolutely enjoyed Matt Smith as Milo. He was my favorite part of this whole movie and I loved seeing his quirkiness play into his role as a villain.",

The character of Morbius, however, could not have been more perfectly cast. Jared Leto really looks like Dr. Morbius, and his very dry speech works for the character, as well (if you've ever read Morbius, his words are written in a font meant to convey darkness, brooding, and potential evil). And his comic appearances, tend to be choppy in their presentation, as well, because they are trying to convey his 'blackouts'. (Note: I am referring to his early appearances in Spider-Man)His movements and the overall story arc, follows his origin story very well. And, as it seems he will be facing Spider-Man, if they capitalize on the mid-credit scene, it ought to be really intriguing to see where they take this character. There is really a lot of potential, that I think many movie-goers missed.Stan would have been proud. Excelsior!",

The character development was unbearably bad; why did Milo turn out the way he did? He was never really shown to be jealous or violent in the beginning, save for a single scene. I would put a spoiler warning, but viewers will be able to deduce what I've said after watching the first three minutes anyway.This film could have been really good. The cast seemed right and the actors looked to have given it their all, but those brainless idiots who wrote the film let down the entire company. Without good writing, a film can't even be ok, and this was downright dogwater.Would not recommend watching, though if you need a good sleep it would be advisable to sit in the cinema.

    "text": "Unlike many people, I don't have a problem with the acting. The problem I think lies in the writing, and by extension, the directing.One important aspect of a good movie is that the characters changes over the course of the movie. They learn something, or become a better (or worse) person through the events of the story. Consider Thor, he learns to take responsibility. Or, Iron Man, he comes to realize the harm his weapons cause and so becomes a hero to fight his former customers.There is no such \"lesson\" learned in Morbius. The Morbius at the end of this move is the essentially same person as he was at the start. Yes, he has become a vampire, but his vampirism doesn't fundamentally change his character. The same is true of every character in the movie. There is one moment in the movie where he loses control, but for the rest of the movie the 'struggle' against the beast within is largely is only implied.This would have been a MUCH better movie if the villain was the beast within, and if Morbius cannot at first resist his urges, and then the movie is him overcoming them and finding an outlet for them. Instead, they keep Morbius fundamentally \"good\" and introduce another villain for him to battle. The end result is ultimately unsatisfying.",

As if wanting to not die is a bad thing. It was predictable apart from the flying and action scenes it was really bad for me. Jared letos acting is great though. In fact I slept off at some point in the cinema. Looking forward to seeing more from marvel.",

    "text": "OK You don't expect Hamlet going into a Marvel movie, and to be fair some of the set pieces work really well. Matt Smith strikes the right balance as the foil, ands for once Jared Leto is also reasonably understated, wisely relying on the effects and makeup to do the donkeywork. That about wraps up the good news.Where to begin with the bad? I think the pseudo-science. Oh the pseudo-science. I get that there has to be a certain amount of gibberish and fudging for the origin story to work, but it seems like the writer only heard about DNA third hand from somebody describing a particularly dodgy episode of CSI.I found myself constantly thinking (and quite possibly muttering) \"no they can't\", \"no it doesn't\" or \"no it wouldn't\" throughout the first third or so of the movie. The very first line uttered was \"vampire bats are tiny but they can take down an animal 10 times their size\". No they can't. And upon delivering this pearl of \"wisdom\" our hero cuts open his hand and thrusts it into the mouth of a cave full of them, which immediately awakens these apparently literal vampire bats and brings them flying out in exactly the kind of a feeding frenzy that they absolutely do not do, like some sort of flying piranhas.The plot, once it gets going, oscillates between tired rehashes of age-old cliches and things that make no sense whatsoever, sometimes both at once. For example (*spoiler alert*) when his best friend inevitably becomes an inexplicably malevolent version of Morbius, there is also no explanation of how this was achieved without the same harrowing series of experiments and gradual changes under controlled laboratory conditions that Morbius underwent. When the clich\u00e9d pair of sick children living in the hospital undergoing gruelling daily treatment (and of course being bullied by healthy children for no apparent reason) grow to manhood, it's never explained how the pair of them survived even though it's explicitly stated that many others before them died. When Smith as the newly powered bad guy picks a fight in a bar by chatting up a Tough Guy's girl and insulting him, it's never explained how the Tough Guys in New York still haven't learned by now that every freak that does this has super powers, since at least 1986 when Jeff Goldlum did it in the remake of The Fly.So yeah, no.",

M\u00f6bius' transition from upstanding scientist to vampire happens in a few scenes. His friend's transition occurs even faster. Instead of showing who people are and showing the way they relate to each other, we're just told. And no one seems to have any trouble believing in vampires - as if they're just a common everyday hazard. Yes, I know it's a comic book story and all, but compared to other recent flicks, this one seems cheap and shallow. Even Marvel's streaming TV series are much better made with much richer storylines.",

It's not a good movie by any means, but it does have some cool fight scenes and horror aspects that boost it from a 4 to a 5. Matt Smith's villain is really interesting and his performance was probably the best part of the entire movie. But the story was so out of place, and some of the scenes felt so rushed and the CGI could use some work here and there. And obviously the worst part was cutting out the Spider-Man references and putting Adrian Toomes's scenes all in the Post-Credits. I stayed for the Post Credits Scenes, and they were just stupid. Overall, I would wait to rent Morbius at home, or wait until it's on streaming, because overall, it's not good.",

    "rating": 6,
    "date": "2022-04-14",
    "text": "Like the previous two installments of Marvel's \"Venom\", \"Morbius \" is yet another take on the dark superhero genre but throws in the vampire genre for good measure. Unfortunately, while \"Venom\" was at least a decently entertaining movie, \"Morbius\" is a huge letdown.The biggest problems with \"Morbius\" is that it's too rushed and suffers from an incredibly lacklustre script. Jared Leto is not a bad fit for the character of Dr. Michael Morbius, a terminally ill man who transforms into a vampiric beast upon injecting himself with an experimental serum designed to cure his life-threatening condition. The serum ends up granting him bat-like superpowers including increased strength, speed and echolocation but the downside is that he must feed on artificial (and eventually human) blood to sustain himself. However, while the concept of Morbius's character is interesting, Leto's efforts are mostly wasted due to an incoherent script. Due to the film's poor writing and characterization, you never sympathize much with Morbius's plight or the tragedy surrounding his relationships with any of the film's supportive characters. Morbius's motivations are all over the place in the film. For example, in contrast with Marvel's Doctor Strange, the movie seems to forget sometimes that Morbius is supposed to be a doctor who's dedicated to saving lives and instead, the movie fails to make him into a compelling hero (or antihero) with no clear motivation. Even Matt Smith's role as the evil vampire antagonist feels wasted due to bad scriptwriting. Matt Smith's charisma could've easily made him an excellent homage to Deacon Frost from Marvel's \"Blade\" who's one of the best vampire antagonists depicted on film. On that note, the film also lacks the seductive, nocturnal atmosphere of urban vampire flicks such as \"Blade\" or\" Underworld.\" The movie never properly dwells on the nocturnal setting that makes urban vampire films and the vampire life in general so captivating and alluring.Overall, the movie isn't terrible but nothing in the film really stands out either. Frankly, the whole film is a painfully mediocre experience whose sole purpose apparently was to introduce Morbius's character to the Spiderman multiverse. That said, I still think Jared Leto is a good fit for the role of Morbius and I still think there's a lot of potential to his character but hopefully his next film appearance is followed by a much better script.",

Dr. Morbius couldn't handle what he himself have became, milo became the villain, morbius' lover was killed by milo, a battle for life between the two friends (a moment that resembles the last dracula with luke evans). Through all of this if a moment was good it was martine's resurrection, except from that, it was boring. It would fit better in dc maybe in the same vibe of the batman.",

    "text": "It should come as no surprise to anyone that movies produced by Sony are middling, at best. Morbius is no exception. The premise is solid but there isn't a whole lot Sony can do with the character given its limited pool of Marvel properties.Morbius is a film that should have come out 5 years later. Similar to Venom, one of the key players in the Morbius mythos is not present (Spiderman). So what we're left with is an origin story to a character that exists in the same universe as Venom but without Spiderman. We're also presented with a villain that, as far as I know, doesn't exist in the comics. Whereas fans of Spiderman were elated to see multiple universes come together in No Way Home, Morbius feels incredibly isolated.Sony simply can't produce quality super hero movies, it seems. Morbius tries hard to be violent and action-packed but has issues with pacing, motivation and relevance.On the up side, Jared Leto does a fine job as Morbius. They kept the design fairly consistent with the comics but as I've already mentioned isolated the character without the appropriate pool of Marvel side characters to work with.The runtime is short enough that you can watch Morbius without losing much of your day and it isn't bad enough to avoid. Morbius is just expectedly disappointing coming from Sony.If you set your expectations low and avoid the troll reviews you may enjoy Morbius. Just know it, like Venom, appears to be too isolated to engage with the greater Marvel story arcs and characters.",

I could see the potential and hoped this would be a gateway to bring Blade into the Marvel universe finally (instead we only get a hint in post credit scenes in Eternals) and while there were moments that were almost brilliant (the hand breaking scene), nothing was fully formed. Character development was wishy washy and some characters seemed quite pointless. Jared Leto always seems a bit self satisfied usually to give a truly engaging performance but I actually think he was perfect for the role of Morbius (if a little too pretty) and as much as I adore Matt Smith, he seemed terribly miscast as the villain. All in all, I didn't hate it and it's not the worst comic book movie I've seen (prize goes to Wonder Woman 1984) but it could have been so much better with a more rounded script and a better villain (if they kept to the character of Hunger e.g)",

    "text": "This film might have been considered interesting sometime in the beginning of this century, but now it's nothing more than a basic superhero plot with no intrigue whatsoever.So what we are dealing with?1) Main charachter's goals and motivationDr. Morbius is a genius of his generation, whose goal (at least on paper) is to cure himself and his friend from a disease that involves constant supply of blood. He finds a cure, but it comes with some drawbacks. Basically the doctor will now have to kill to stay alive. I believe this was a basic promise for this movie. However when we first see Jared Leto I can't help but think, that he was an awful idea for this role. His character doesn't show any regard for human life and if he has to deal with life-or-death situation he seems to save lives out of necessity and not because of his moral principles. That's why when he finally has to kill (at the end of the second act) I don't get any emotional feedback for his deed. Usually this kind of action shows us how far has the main hero fallen and why they should be considered an antihero, e.g. Remember how unconcerned Lou was when Rick was killed (Nightcrawler).2) Interaction between characters.In the second scene of the movie two of our main characters meet each other and the \"eternal\" friendship begins. The only act of care for each other happens exactly in this scene, when Morbius saves Loxias's life due to morbius's unprecedented genius. After that we don't get nearly any scene that shows Matt Smith and Jared Leto being friends. Why you ask? Because movie doesn't have time for this. A few moments later Matt Smith's character already becomes the bad guy and well is now to be stopped.Basically the same transpires between Morbius and other side characters. There's no chemistry between any of them.3) And finally the awful third act consisting of a lot of CGI mess and some questionable decisions by the main antihero. This finale is so basic so I can't even be bothered to describe it, you have seen it some many times already, so you know what's going to happen before it all even begins.Epilogue: a few years ago this movie might have been considered \"quite good\", but for 2022 it's an awful movie that thankfully will fail at the box office.4/10\nJared Leto won't be appearing in any cinematic universe soon \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0fP. S. I think the only way to pull you to the cinemas to watch the movie may be Michael Keaton's appearance. However it happens only in the after-credit scenes and remains ambiguous.",

At the same time there were mentions of the boat scene that were involved in the origin comics that pleased me a bit.As for the visuals I enjoyed them. From the slow motion to the sonar ability. Few scenes stood out from the occasional wonky edited background. (Pretty normal for action-based film). Like I said before I was satisfied with the visual effects.All in all it was a pretty average film for Sony.

Spoiler alert: one of my favourite scene is when one of the characters does a funny dance. Definitely the most underrated movie of all time.Ok but seriously, everything about this film is bad. None of the characters have any development, and I really hope we don't see Morbius again. The mid and post credit scenes were also the worst I've seen in a Marvel movie.

    "text": "When Dr. Michael Morbius said \"it's morbin time\" in the theater I burst into a frenzy of pure joybius as my favorite comic book character had finally been properly adapted into a movie. My good friend Jared Leto starred as Dr. Michael Morbius in the movie and when I received this news I became ecstatic as that was the role he was born to play! In the second post credit scene of Morbius, Dr. Michael Morbius was transported to the future where he see's the Morbius franchise has expanded beyond anybody's wildest dreams. The movies villian, Reverse Morbius pushed our hero (Dr. Michael Morbius) to his furthest point as he was forced to kill his long time friend. When I saw this scene in the theater I began to sob uncontrollably since I knew that Dr. Michael Morbius had just broken his hard moral code of never killing during the movie, luckily for me the movie ended 30 seconds after Reverse Morbius died. The first post credit scene was a short scene from Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, in this scene we see that Dr. Michael Morbius is part of the illuminati, alongside Dr. Michael Morbius is Walter Hartwell White, Red Crewmate, Jesse Pinkman, and Darth Vader. Morbius was such a compelling movie that made me feel more than a Morbillion emotions all at once during the entire runtime of the feature length film. The movie was such a critical success that it sold 7 Morbillion tickets in 3 days, which gives it two world records, highest grossing movie of all time, and best movie of all time. Morbius is the movie of all time, it had a script, there were actors, a director, no CGI, it was edited, and the main character is called Dr. Michael Morbius. I have purchased 500 Morbillion copies of the film digitally and physically, I also saw the film in theaters 800 Morthousand times. Another excellent scene in Morbius was the scene where Dr. Michael Morbius has recently taken the Morbius serum and entered a new laboratory saying \"I am Venom\". Morbius is the peak of all entertainment and the human race is blessed to have had Dr. Michael Morbius grace our theater screens in our lifetime. Jared Leto personally told me at the premiere of Morbius that this was one of the roles in his acting career, he also said that I would be able to have a small role in the 2060 film, Morbinity War, and its sequel Morbgame. This movie changed my life, before I was sad because there was no movie on earth that could satisfy my emotions, until Morbius came out in 2022 and when it did, I became filled with joybius and morbsomeness. In conclusion, Morbius is the movie and I enjoybiused it very much.",

His old friend also injects that antidote in order to compete Morbius, there was nothing in the story guys. IT IS JUST A NORMAL STORY!!!But it is a marvel film so of course it will have a post credit scene and that is the only scene which will make you surprise and feel like post credit scene makes a little sense than the whole movie. After watching Vulture come back, I'm really excited to know what will happen in further Spider-Man movies.Acting was a bit better by the actors, but still I would say that this movie is average. The only thing that can make this movie better is that there should be a crossover of Morbius and Spider-Man, I mean not like Venom that a little of venom remains in Tom Holland Spider-Man's universe as shown in Spider-Man: No Way Home. I mean like Morbius and Vulture vs. Spider-Man (Tom Holland or Andrew Garfield)",

Ending of the movie made absolutely no sense either and ended with trying to figure out how people were coming back alive. Didn't like this movie at all. Plus it was too censored just make it rated R and be done with it already.",

The conflict between Morbius and Milo Seemed to come out of nowhere.They went from being best friends to mortal enemies in a matter of seconds. And Morbius seems to be able to control his lust after the initial bloodfest while Milo was ready to kill anybody at a second glance- even his lifelong doctor. That seemed Highly unbelievable and very weak for a plot.The climax - meaning the fight between Morbius and Milo - ended about the same time it started - so it was a bit of a letdown. They were both brothers to the bats - so why did the bats listen to Morbius and attack Milo? It makes no sense. Overall the movie had potential - but it was weak after Milo took the serum. And I guess now the hot female Dr. Is a bloodthirsty vampire. Weak.",

Like the club, killing the other doctor and then trying to kill Michael?-And for the first time I did not like CGI because it meant less of Matt Smith's actual face.-Even though the smokey kind of effect for powers were cool, it looked much like a smelling power rather than a hearing one.Overall an okay introduction to a new character but a movie that treats the actors in it really badly. May be sony had other plans for it and had to cut it into something else.Also, Keaton appearing in this universe makes no sense.",

Sony just uses the same played out boring formula for their supe movies. Honestly, how hard is it to stop making the same mistakes in every movie? Their world has zero cohesion. It's like they are trying to build something like the mcu, but it is not working. Its time to fire every employee that has been involved and start from scratch before the hole is dug any deeper.",

The problem is that morbius has no connection or conflict with spider-man. The comics had morbius use spider-mans blood to become a monster, they stripped that away. This was clearly an experiment in disjointed spider-man side characters without using spider-man. It also fell hard into the dark and grungy trope of modern movies trying to be batman.This got a 2 and not a 1 for two reasons: it did mostly adhere to the morbius character arc, and atleast its not Eternals.",

Morbius becomes a bad guy? Even though he has saved thousands of people in his life and did not want to kill everyone? What?

It's incredible that Sony is the worst company for these type of movies. Marvel SHOULD take more ownership even though they may not make any profit from it, but we need to keep Venom, Morbius and the rest of the characters, for any crossover movie in the future!!! This movie has a lot of plot holes, and this could've been avoided if they made the movie at least 2h and explain a lot of things that we couldn't see. FINALLY, they should've deleted those post-credit scenes, as these don't make any sense!!!! They shouldn't have used Tobey's Spidey to promote the movie or that \"reversed effect\" of the spell of Dr. Strange... C'mon!!!",

    "text": "I enjoyed about the fist half hour of the film, but I am a sucker for movies that tell the origin stories, as over done as they have become. I could watch Peter Parker become Spiderman for hours and not get boredThe movie started out well; a bit cliched and dragged out, but in origin story movies that is the name of the game most of the time.The thing is that they did a cop out; they wanted to have Michael noble antihero. And he's only the antihero because he's obsessed with finding a cure for his disease.The best part of the movie was Matt Smith because his character should have been Michael Morbius. It would have actually made it somewhat more compelling if Milo, had actually decided not to take the cure, despite how much he wanted it and how much fun Michael made it out to be a vampire. Imagine his character making the conscious choice of having the cure right in his hands and not taking it because, despite all appearances, Michael is not the same man.In that moment, when Michael sees his lifelong friend reject his life work and himself, he truly goes berserk and does all the things Matt Smith did. Milo tries to stop him, weak as he is and he dies in their final confrontation, while Michael still tries to turn him.This death would force Morbius to realize that he had become a monster and the last shots of the movie are him trying to atone for what he did.I wanted an evil Michael Morbius and to see his descent into darkness.It's not a bad movie, but it could have been so much better.",

It caters to every viewer, as it packs exhilarating action, great comedy, and chill-inducing horror into its breezy 104 minute (1hr 44min for the uninitiated) runtime. Jared Leto gives perhaps the performance of a lifetime as Dr. Michael Morbius as he convincingly captures intelligence and wit of the beloved Marvel legend. However, his performance is overshadowed by Matt Smith, who gives a deliciously evil turn as the villain Milo, while Tyrese Gibson shows the detective and his overwhelming responsibility of ending this quarrel of vampires. Speaking of Gibson, his reaction to Martin Scorsese's praise of the cinematic masterpiece was entirely justified, as I myself fully agree with the Shark Tale star's comments.",

You start off with Morbius getting off a helicopter with a crew and doing some bay summoning thing and then it back tracks to him as a kid. Then later it jumps back to him as an adult but you never find out when that helicopter scene took place. When did he get a crew? He has no friends or affiliations with anyone besides this one chick and the bad guy. Also, who is this girl? Are they friends and he's gay? Are they into each other? There's also his I guess former caretaker who's also the caretaker for his disabled friend who's obvious going to be the bad guy with the same powers that we need. The guy also gives a speech at some point and seems to indicate he works for the queen? Bad guy friend does the whole green goblin from amazing Spider-Man 2 thing where he wants Morbius's vampire medicate but Morbius is a dick and won't give it to him. Then a bunch of unfinished scenes are slapped together and there's some cops but they don't do anything. Also Morbius is a murderer and not a good guy in any way. Then everyone claps because this dumpster fire of a movie is over but wait it's not! After credits scene of the vulture blipping into this awful universe. Okay fine but WAIT one more! The vulture gets a new vulture suit out of absolutely nowhere and wants to team up with Morbius even though one of them is a \"good\" vampire doctor guy and the other is an evil thief with a magical alien tech suit. What do they have in common in any way? Get completely wasted before you watch this movie.",

However, the way it was delivered in this movie made it seem cheap and rushed.I was also excited to see Matt Smith, who demonstrated great acting, but his character was an overused trope. Overall, it was boring, the fight scenes were all pretty much the same, too many slow mos that gave the movie a cheap look. Some of the lines were pretty cringe, \"You don't want to see me when I'm hungry\" Yada yada... Matt Smith dancing was the only thing I really enjoyed. Hope that if they ever introduce Morbs in any of the Spider Movies, they'll give his character a bit more personality instead of making it all about motive. Killing Dr Bancroft (His lab partner) was supposed to justify killing his best friend, but yet again... overused trope.I usually don't mind iffy CGI but it was boring how the 'Bat Vamp face' just appeared off and on like it was Vampire Diaries or something. I would prefer a more gruelling portrayal, perhaps with detailed changes with audible popping of facial features, twisting into the creepy look, maybe even some teeth details.In my opinion this movie would of worked much better with a bit of good old fashioned gore. Afterall why make the face so detailed and 'scary' if you're not going to detail how it rips people's throats out.Pretty bummed out cause I like Marvel and Vampires.",

    "text": "My name is Micheal Morbius. I'm probably 20 something years old. My house is in the northeast section of New York, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the research people idk, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink blood. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.",

I saw this movie with my son, Jamarquis, and we sat in the front row. I was so excited to see Jared Leto of Suicide Squad Clown fame in another fun super hero flick for me and my son to watch. My little boy. We saw every flake of coke in Jared Leto's luscious brown beard from our comfy front row seats. When the action started, I just about darn near bursted out of my trousers! My son, my beautiful son, he started screaming uncontrollably as his chest hair grew in and his bones stretched until he grew to a lofty 5'11\". He grew long thick hair on his face and scalp, and his eyes turned a beautiful powder blue. As soon as I saw them, I recognized that beautiful youthful sparkle. He turned to me and stared silently into my eyes as if to say I am okay now father. \"Jared Leto, thank you\" I whispered to the screen, as I accepted the new man my son had become.",

Yes, I am a tolerant person, I try to respect other opinions as much as possible, but I had to speak out about Morbius.Like many people, I didn't expect anything from the film, I didn't think about anything, but from the first 10 minutes I already knew the film was full of trash. To me, Dr. Morbius seemed like a little arrogant boy, so he always mixed up the name Milo, because of this, I personally started to associate him a bit with negative character.The actors' acting was good, but it was as if the script was not written with a hand, and even for superhero films there was very little logic, and now I'm trying to erase some mistakes:\nthe multi-millionth equipment is not guarded by anyone (this is when Michael's friend stole the medicines);there are no surveillance cameras in the subway and hospitals (this is when a nurse was killed, and a fight in the subway when a lot of people were killed)from nowhere his close friend Milo moans as the enemy (it's unclear because, if the medicines are so negetively affects to a person)love line (when I first saw this couple, I could not imagine that they would love each other, because in the beginning there was no lightning hint, because of this I did not have a drop of emotion for the heroes)And the biggest blunder in my opinion and the biggest disappointment was the scene after the credits when the Vulture appeared and offered to kill Spider-Man, he immediately agreed. WHAAAAAAAAT? Are you serious about what a friendly neighbor did to him? Like common scriptwriter.In theory, I like the acting of Jared Leto, but for the second time he is associated with a not well-developed hero. He has very good films like \"Requiem for a Dream\", \"American Psycho\", \"Fight Club\", here he is an outstanding actor and lately he has been failing. I think that we will not see a sequel, the film grossed only $ 163.2 million at the box office, which is very little even compared to the second Venom. After the discussion, I can only put:\n3 out of 10.",

For instance; I understand why you would do illegal experiments in international waters. What it never explains is who the mercs are and why they are their. I mean I know why they're there is because we need someone Morbius can kill that won't make us hate him but seriously why we're they there story wise? It's just a huge mess and I hate that I have the studio money which may help them to decide to press on with their garbage plan of a universe.",

Michael turns out morphing into a blood-thirsty hero with an array of superpowers including superhuman speed, strength and auditory perception. Michael's surrogate brother and best friend, Milo Morbius, happens to be tormented by the same disease, and asks Michael to give him the same DNA-changing injection. Michael, fearful of transforming Milo into a monster like himself, declines to do so. Furious, Milo finds the venom, injects it himself and becomes bloodily violent. Michael is left with no choice but to fight his good friend.Sounds familiar, huh? Isn't it reminiscent of The Amazing Spiderman 2? Peter Parker's friend Harry Osborn is desperately ill and believes that Spiderman's blood is the key to curing his terminal disease. Peter, worrying that his blood will be incompatible with Harry's and hence kill him, has all along kept back his superhero identity. Harry somehow finds his way to get the spider venom. Unfortunately, he doesn't become another Spiderman but an aggressive monster with intemperate evilness. And the two eventually have to fight each other.The story of Morbius is way too familiar, too monotonous and too predictable.The unimpressive computer-generated effects are what adds to to the mediocrity of this movie. The Morbius brothers' calamitous vampire outlook is just a complete thumbs-down.",

Between the overacting of Jared Leto and the god awful screen play which must have been done by a bunch of random strangers. This movie had no storyline. Also in most cases of a bad movie one could say well I could see what they were trying to do, oh but no not with Morbius this movie was a complete disaster. Also for those of you who still had a little energy to watch the secret scene where Michael Keaton (the vulture) shows up out of no where and apparently decides to join Morbius even though they are not in the same timeline. Also not to mention this movie was essentially Milo being bitter and Jared Leto screaming half the time. This basically combined a hint of Harley Quinn and Batman with Spider-Man, Venom, etc. This essentially was a combination and a spin off that ruined the comic and will forever give it a bad name. Last but not least this whole atrocity could have ended if the idiot Morbius just hid or secured the elixir thing.Kind regards.",

    "text": "This essay began as a chapter of Parlare the Carny but as I worked on it - appropriately enough - it took on a life of its own. Whereas the main essay assumes no prior knowledge of Bakhtin and his work I've taken that for granted this time: if you are new to dialogism I suggest you read Parlare first. The essay was initially inspired by Michael Holquist's Bakhtinian analysis of Frankenstein in Dialogism: Bakhtin and His World (1990) but takes Bakhtin's ideas in a new direction. I hope you enjoy it!\"Did I request thee, Maker from my clay\nTo mould me man?Did I solicit thee\nFrom darkness to promote me?\"John Milton, Paradise Lost (X.743-5)The way that carnivalesque crowning and dethroning, grotesque realism and Bakhtin's dialogical conceptions of language, identity and authorship interact can best be demonstrated through an exploration of one of the series most grotesque stories, The Brain of Morbius.The Brain of Morbius opens with the death and dismemberment of an insectoid alien resembling - since it uses the same costume! - a Mutant from the 1972 story The Mutants: the Doctor identifies this alien as a 'Mutt'. The Mutants is set on the planet Solos, of course, a name echoed by the name of this story's second, non-eponymous antagonist, Solon: for the seasoned Doctor Who viewer, we are already in intertextual territory. What's more, this butchery is carried out by a being who is himself fragmented and incomplete: Solon's hook-handed servant Condo. Intertextuality and and its relationship to the fragmented, grotesque body will become a recurrent theme of this story.We learn early on that the Doctor and Sarah have landed 'close' to the Doctor's home planet ('Well, within a couple of billion miles, yes.') - the closest he's been since his origin was revealed in The War Games. 'Origin' is a theme we will return to.We are also informed that the Doctor has been sent here against his will:DOCTOR: Come out, meddlesome, interfering idiots. I know you're up there so come on out and show yourselves! Messing about with my Tardis. Dragging us a thousand parsecs off course.SARAH: Oi, have you gone potty? Who are you shouting at?DOCTOR: The Time Lords, who else? Now, you see? You see? They haven't even got the common decency to come out and show their ears.SARAH: They're probably afraid of getting them boxed, the way you're carrying on.DOCTOR: It's intolerable. I won't stand for any more of it.SARAH: Oh look, why can't it have just gone wrong again?DOCTOR: What?SARAH: The Tardis.DOCTOR: What? Do you think I don't know the difference between an internal fault and an external influence? Oh, no, no, no. There's something going on here, some dirty work they won't touch with their lily white hands. Well, I won't do it, do you hear!AdvertisementsREPORT THIS ADNevertheless, the Doctor has no choice but to follow the role assigned to him by the archetectonics of answerability: he has no alibi in existence.The Brain of Morbius' most obvious intertext is Mary Shelley's Gothic novel Frankenstein: or The Modern Prometheus - or, more accurately, the various film and theatre adaptations of that novel with which Morbius shares significant (centripetal) similarities and (centrifugal) differences. Both Morbius and Frankenstein tell the story of a scientist who transgresses the laws of nature by (re)creating life from the scavenged body parts of the dead. Solon and Victor Frankenstein are very much Romantic conceptions of the scientist, and Michael Holquists's 'dialogical' analysis of Frankenstein is worth considering here:\"Victor Frankenstein embodies (with all the irony that attends the use of the word in the novel) the principle of uniqueness: he is the quintessential Romantic artist\"Michael Holquist, Dialogism: Bakhtin and His WorldFor Frankenstein the secret of imparting life to dead flesh marks him as unique since it is 'one secret which I alone possessed'. Solon is not shy about boasting of his unique achievements either:SOLON: I've made so many discoveries. I have mastered new techniques no other man has even conceived. I can transplant limbs, organs. I can create life. And all against the most appalling difficulties.MORBIUS: Yet I am still here! I can see nothing, feel nothing. You have locked me into hell for eternity. If this is all there is for me, I would sooner die now.SOLON: There is so much at stake. I cannot afford to take a risk. Every step is an advance into new fields of surgery. Every step has got to be tested.MORBIUS: Solon! You desire to be know as the creator of Morbius, rather than his servant.Frankenstein and Solon's 'uniqueness' are, however, thrown into question both intertextually and intratextually.Intertextually, the novel's subtitle, The Modern Prometheus, belies the 'uniqueness' of Victor Frankenstein by alluding to literary precedent: Prometheus, the Titan who stole fire from the Gods. Solon is modeled on Victor Frankenstein and therefore embodies not only Frankenstein's own literary ancestry but all of his hundreds of theatrical, literary, film and television descendants.Like Victor, Frankenstein's monster - an articulate, literate creature in the book - also makes claims to uniqueness and loneliness - and these claims are also expressed in intertextual terms:\"No sympathy may I ever find. When I first sought it, it was the love of virtue, the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole being overflowed, that I wished to be participated. But now that virtue has become to me a shadow and that happiness and affection are turned into bitter and loathing despair, in what should I seek for sympathy? I am content to suffer alone while my sufferings shall endure: when I die, I am well satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory. Once my fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment. I falsely hoped to meet with beings who, pardoning my outward form, would love me for the excellent qualities which I was capable of unfolding. I was nourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion. But now crime has degraded me beneath the meanest animal. No guilt, no mischief, no malignity, no misery, can be found comparable to mine. When I run over the frightful catalogue of my sins, I cannot believe that I am the same creature whose thoughts were once filled with sublime and transcendent visions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness. But it is even so; the fallen angel becomes a malignant devil. Yet even that enemy of God and man had friends and associates in his desolation; I am alone.\"AdvertisementsREPORT THIS ADMary Shelly, Frankenstein: Or The Modern PrometheusPerhaps no character in Doctor Who suffers the carnivalesque degredations of Morbius:MORBIUS: Trapped like this, like a sponge beneath the sea. Yet even a sponge has more life than I. Can you understand a thousandth of my agony? I, Morbius, who once led the High Council of the Time Lords and dreamed the greatest dreams in history, now reduced to this, to a condition where I envy a vegetable!There are obvious similarities between the Creature's self-pitying speech about the unfulfillment of his 'dreams of virtue' and Morbius, 'who once ... dreamed the greatest dreams in history' and his envy for the life of a sponge - yet despite their claims to a unprecedented suffering both allude to Satan, the 'fallen angel' of Milton's Paradise Lost from which Shelley's novel also takes it's preface.As we'll see both Milton's poem and the myth of Prometheus provide as much an intertextual background to The Brain of Morbius as Mary Shelley's novel does.Just as Solon intertextually embodies all the literary precedents and antecedents of Victor Frankenstein, so the Morbius creature embodies a thousand Frankenstein Monsters. As Holquist says of Frankenstein's monster:\"Frankenstein's monster springs from the library as much as he does from the charnel house and laboratory: he is made up not only of other bodies from the past, but, like Mary Shelley's novel, from other books from the past\"-Michael Holquist, Dialogism: Bakhtin and His WorldHe is made from parts of other texts as well as bodies, from the disjecta membra of literature. The Brain of Morbius borrows from film and theatre adaptations of Frankenstein as much as from Shelley's novel.There are significant differences between Frankenstein and The Brain of Morbius, however, not least in each monsters' relationship with language. Frankenstein's monster begins as a mute but over the progress of the novel he enters the chain of existence through his acquisition of language: for a brief while he is even able to trick the blind De Lacey into thinking he is human. Morbius's trajectory, however, is in the opposite direction. Morbius begins the story as a disembodied brain, deprived of all human characteristics other than speech: he is constituted entirely in language (and what an eloquent speaker he is! He must have been a fearsome orator among the High Council.) For a moment the blinded Sarah too believes she is talking to a human being. It is only in the closing moments of his life that he is rendered speechless, divorced from the chain of existence, regressing literally a state of infancy (the word is derived from the Latin, infans, meaning 'unable to speak' or 'speechless') .Intratextually, Solon an Morbius, and Victor and the Creature, operate as doubles of each other: indeed, there is constant slippage between their roles as master and creation (in fact, a Mystery and Imagination adaptation of Frankenstein for ITV in 1968 even had Frankenstein and the monster played by the same actor, Ian Holme). 'You are my creator' says Frankenstein's monster, 'but I am your master'; a sentiment echoed by Morbius' 'You desire to be known as the creator of Morbius rather than his servant' quoted above.",

The movie actually made me more interested in the character.I'm hoping someone can clarify this for me but did the female lead actually say \"Noble Prize\" instead of \"Nobel Prize\"? What doctor on earth doesn't know it's Nobel?How does the female lead decide to close her eyes and kiss Morbius for the first time right after he almost eats her because she cut her finger? Why wouldn't they kiss before the boat scene or right before the experiment on the boat to strengthen the feelings before it goes wrong? Who couldn't see that fix?And by the way why did they make it seem like she almost chopped her finger off and had to stitch herself up from a can lid?If morbius was taking apart machines as a kid and got in trouble with milo for doing that, it would have made more sense when he fixed the machine.Why not have morbius and milo both get beat up by the kids, have morbius save milo, and then have milo go psycho and beat the bully to a pulp before being stopped by the doc.Oh and why did the doc look the same 20 years later?So did anyone tell the Nobel award winning doctor who invented artifical blood, that they have blood banks? With a rich benefactor (unexplained how he got rich), why couldn't they pay people to donate blood and have a never ending supply? Would he really need to kill himself or kill others? Why not just make up some thing about oxygen and temperature or some protein breakdown, etc...Great jump scare in the movie, why not a couple more?Movie fell flat because it tripped over its own inattention to details.Worth the watch, but they should reshoot a few scenes, re-edit, and re-release with a post credit scene, featuring Blade.A good story with some bad mistakes that someone should have caught and fixed.",

The Character development was pretty good and I really like how They slowed it down in the middle of a few of the action scenes. There was also some plot twist like when Milo became a Villian and when Morbius Gilrfriend became a Vampire towards the end of the movie. And the post end credit scene where they talked about Spiderman was so good. So in the end this is a movie you should go see and plays a big part in the Marvel World.",

Taking the lab from the men and then literally 5 min later being back at his OG lab, Matt Smith dancing for 3 min attempting to make being a vampire cool or sexy)? NO. We saw no real turmoil from any of the characters when they realize they have to MURDER TO SURVIVE. And we saw no learning to gain control of powers from Morbius's character, it quite literally went one second from Morbius killing people on accident because he needs blood, to him getting vicious at the sight of a TINY cut, then to him being completely fine with blood when with his dying sliced open mentor, all in a span of 10 min. Continuing with that point he didn't need any trial and error when it came to anything he did. One second he had never flown, to the next second he just felt the airwaves and was off. The plot was so fast pace I genuinely felt like Fantastic Four (2016) was paced better and that film was catastrophic. There was no cohesiveness when it came to any of the scenes (ex. Bancroft being in her apartment being watched by Milo, to the next scene she is out on the street somehow aware the police are following her). The ending was extremely flat with no real battle which I expect when going into any film characterized as \"action/adventure\". Also Slo-mo fights DON'T MAKE FILMS INTERESTING, it wasted the time needed to develop the plot. Next time use those extra thirty seconds and budget into making a better storyline. I also can't tell how the end credit scene makes any sense as to how does Toomes somehow get transported to the wrong universe (thanks to No Way Home) and how does he get his suit, which I had assumed wouldn't have been transported with him. I believe the changes from the trailer and what was shown may have been done due to reshoots but at least make the reshoots more visually interesting and exciting than the trailer shots. I'm not a huge vampire fan, with that being said I am a huge Marvel fan, and this film had me in pieces the whole time. Scenes that were meant to be serious ended up being hilarious because they were so pointless. I understand origin stories have a lot to pack in a short time frame, but they have been done well as shown by Venom and the majority of the other Marvel films which had much more intricate and appealing plots.",

There was no character development, got boring, half the things I was excited for weren't even in the movie, trailer is just a liar, editing was alright, didn't feel like the characters have any relationships with each other than trying to be a doctor and their patient. I don't even think I got the names of the characters other than Michael and Milo. Plotline was also all over the place. The way the story was laid out felt dull, the beginning had a weird start, and the neon pink intro didn't make sense considering the movie I was watching. The relationship between Bancroft and Michael felt forced and unnecessary. Milo also starts dancing out of nowhere which I cringed at. The ending with Michael calling the bats was predictable, fights were short and the freeze frames I hated, because it's also unnecessary considering how many times it was used. It felt like a clich\u00e9 monster villain movie when he drank the artificial blood and when he was at the jail. There was weird jumps in time which confused me. When Milo was introduced with Michael as children, I got confused on who was who, and Milo suddenly taking the serum and accepting the vampire \"lifestyle\" did and didn't make sense for his character. I don't even know why Vulture was there since he was originally from the MCU when the multiverse thing happened. This didn't bring it and the only thing carrying the movie was the flying, running, speed scenes, and they were just alright.There was potential for an amazing, badass vampire movie with violence, action, and humor. I even like the actor that played Morbius in the movie. But only by the way he looked for this kind of character. The creators can try again or remember this as a horrible take on a Spiderman villain.",

There was a scene where a orbits slits a man's throat. There is no visible blood, but that is the point, the man clearly has 0 morbiucells in his body, which means that his blood lacks color, his death is extra painful, and he will not go to heaven. I got this info from the book of Leto, which is known as one of books of all time. I can confirm that this Movie IS A MOVIE. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Cya next time, ITS MORBIN TIME.",

In truth I don't think any of the performances were bad per se, but they were all so bland.It didn't help the characters that the writing was so poor. They had no faith in the audience at all, spoon feeding us exposition in the most clunky ways imaginable.The action was truly dreadful. It was either in super slow-mo which exposed the poor CGI, or it was at super speed to the point you were just watching blurs.The story was so basic and formulaic. I hate to say it but I was actually bored watching it. The pacing also felt very off, as the film came to a very abrupt end, before subjecting us to some bonkers credits scenes.I can forgive bad writing. I can forgive bad action. I can forgive a weak plot. But there is one thing in a film I can't forgive and that is when it leaves me bored. As a result Morbius scores a measly 3/10.",

    "text": "This is an early review. There are no plot details (spoilers) here, however if you want to go in completely clean, then skip the rest of this review. Not that there is anything to reveal.The basic set up as depicted in the trailers and advertising is that Michael Morbius is a doctor in the Marvel Universe who is afflicted by a rare and gruesome blood disease. Setting out to find a cure for himself and others of his ilk, he winds up becoming a vampire and proceeds to go head first into adventures in the same vicinity of Spider-Man. This is all in the marketing material that has appeared over the past two years.Speaking of the trailer, there is zero connection to other Marvel movies nor the MCU in this film. Essentially everything you saw in the trailers does not exist in this movie. Like at all. This is studio executive meddling and false advertising at its pinnacle.In terms of technical filmmaking, this is a mess. The action is a disaster. It harkens back to the disastrous comic book entries from the days of yore, a la the horrific Fan4stic, X-Men Origins Wolverine, Thor2 and Green Lantern. It's just one messy CGI PG13 cut scene after another. I don't know if the director, Daniel Espinosa or the studio are to blame, however, given the fact that Tom Rothman, the Perpetrator in Chief of Sony, was also head of 20th Century Fox back when they were churning horrific movies, my money is that the disastrous production that is Morbius is to be blamed on Tom Rothman and his henchman suits at Sony.",

    "rating": 6,
    "date": "2022-03-31",
    "text": "Entertaining and very atmospheric, Morbius manages to serve up yet another helping of campy superhero indulgence despite many little flaws. I'll start off with the problems I had with this film- that mainly being its blatant editing and CGI. I know many people say this about a lot of superhero films, but coming from a horror lovers perspective- as well as fitting the atmospheric and tone Life director Daniel Espinosa seemed to pair within it- this movie really should have been rated R. It feels like Sony really did censor and edit this one as much as they could have, with the blood and violence being as limited as possible. It takes away from the experience as a whole, one moment in particular where a man acts like his throat is cut open but there is LITERALLY NOTHING THERE. Unsurprisingly, as with the case with a lot of films like this, the CGI can be a bit overused at times. For the most part I liked the look of vampire blood hungry Morbius taken on by Jared Leto- but other similar CGI and at times that CGI itself can feel a bit too ugly and forced for comfort. The fight scenes towards the end in particular are also overdone with CGI, and I just really wish Sony would have let the people working on this film give some life to the project instead of worrying about its box office gross. I know i've complained a lot so far, but in terms of a film- I oddly did enjoy this one for the most part. Sure it's messy, Matt Smith's character is a bit over the top and it has some formulaic moments- but it is a very entertaining film. Leto and Arjona give their all to their performances and it has a lot of cool ideas and concepts that are interesting to see fleshed out on screen- particularly with Morbius in particular as he begins to learn how to control himself. There's a lot of humanity hidden beneath the surface in this film though, even with some formulaic moments, there's a lot of depth and heart put into the titular character and it really allows you to empathize both with the film's story as well as Leto on screen. In the end, I enjoyed Morbius- it is far from perfect but it was a solid superhero endeavor and I'm curious to see what they may do with this character next.My Rating: 6.3/10.",

    "text": "I have to admit that I had really been looking forward to watching \"Morbius\" ever since I saw the first trailer. And having been reading the comic books, I will say that Michael Morbius is one of my favorite Marvel characters, so it was nice that the character was finally brought to the big screen.But then the movie was delayed and delayed again, and once finally out a lot of bad reviews were swarming the movie, so I was actually somewhat reluctant and hesitant about actually sitting down to watch it. But I decided to ignore the bad reviews and go see how the movie would treat the comic book character.Writers Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless managed to put together a fair enough storyline. I will say that it was aimed more at an audience fully and wholly unfamiliar with the Michael Morbius character. And I can understand that approach to the first movie with the character, as to introduce a whole new audience of viewers to the character, and not go in on the deep end and do fan service to us whom have been reading the comic books for years.Personally I had hoped for a bit more in terms of story, but it was actually adequate enough in terms of entertainment. An origin story for a character new to the cinema screen is in its place, I suppose.I was also somewhat hesitant about it being Jared Leto to don the mantle of the living vampire, given the swing and miss performance of Joker in the 2016 \"Suicide Squad\", but then again he was amazing in the 2000 movie \"Requiem for a Dream\". Thankfully, then his performance as Michael Morbius was quite good and actually was suitable for the character from the comic books.Visually then you are in for quite a treat, given the fact that this is a Marvel movie. The CGI and special effects are quite impressive in the movie, as they are in all Marvel movies. So if you enjoy flashy CGI and special effects, then \"Morbius\" doesn't disappoint.All in all, then I will say that I was more than adequately entertained by the 2022 movie \"Morbius\", though I had hoped for a bit more in the story department. But hopefully the future will add more layers to the character and his story.My rating of director Daniel Espinosa's 2022 movie lands on a seven out of ten stars.",

    "text": "Delayed a total of 6 times on its way to its eventual release this week around the world, Sony and Marvel's collaboration to bring its anti-hero Dr. Michael Morbius to life appeared to be one of those cursed productions that was doomed from the start and upon seeing this toothless and spineless comic book adaptation on the big screen its safe to say that the world would've been far better off had Morbius stayed delayed permanently.An incredibly inept feature from director Daniel Espinosa, who somehow keeps getting Hollywood films to make with significant budgets and name brand casts despite never actually directing a good film, Morbius feels far removed from most brands associated with the Marvel name as its $75 million dollar budget is nowhere to be found on screen as a blur of video game like CGI, amateurishly scripted scenes and poorly acted characters hog the films lifeless 100 minute runtime that can't come to an end quick enough.Failing as an origin story, with Michael's entire history set-up in one cringe-worthy flashback scene, an unnerving vampire tale and an action comic book film, it's hard to know what Morbius thought it was doing with its potentially entertaining material as Espinosa lets his leading man Jared Leto flounder in yet another high profile role that begs us to ask the question about his talent as a Hollywood leading man while he as a director ensures Morbius is nothing but an enigma of a character lost in a diabolical story that's hard to recall even mere minutes from walking out of the cinema.Sometimes with films that fail as badly as Morbius does there's snippets of what might have been found within them, moments that show not all hope was lost at all times but that's not the case with Espinosa and Leto's blockbuster that truly has no moments of escape from its grim, shaky cam filled collation of cinematic rubbish with the only slight glimpse of a better film coming from Matt Smith's villain Milo (yes that is what he is called throughout most of the film, Milo) with the well-liked one time Dr. Who at least appearing to have fun with his role while everyone else is about as enthusiastic as a bloodsucker heading into their coffin for a day time nap.Undoubtedly developed by Sony and Marvel to play a key role in the future with both Venom and Spider-Man properties, its hard to imagine how anyone will get excited coming away from this when it comes to the prospect of more Morbius being present in the biggest movie brand name going around and despite an attempt mid-credits too get audiences enthused by what may lay in store for Leto's charisma free biochemist in the near future, most will be merely rushing to the exit door to escape what is quite possibly the worst Marvel film we've yet seen.Final Say -Things never looked to good for poor old Morbius but not even the most pessimistic of pundits could've expected a film quite as bad as the one we get here, a DOA offering without purpose, intent or creativity, Marvel would do well to ensure Morbius never awakens again from a very long and hidden away slumber.1/2 a blood bag out of 5.For more reviews visit Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",

I am familiar with the character and have read the comics and I was not disappointed with what Leto and Smith respectively brought to their roles.

    "text": "Let's get one thing straight here: when we all saw the trailers for Morbius, we thought it was a joke. An April Fool's joke, to be precise. Hell, the film even came out on April Fool's Day. But when it did, it received less than stellar reviews from critics. Let me just say: all these critics who are giving it 1/5s and 2/10s, they just couldn't comprehend the complex themes present in Morbius and in their rage and confusion left a negative review. That is completely fine. We all make mistakes. Now, after my 103rd viewing of Morbius, I think I'm at least somewhat ready to leave a review of the film.Morbius is, simply put, the greatest movie of all time. Everything in this movie is more than amazing, in fact my 10/10 is underselling Morbius' true greatness. The lore, plot and themes are complex, and it'll require multiple viewings of Morbius to get the full story, and the acting is perfect. It's like these were real people, especially with Jared Leto's character, Dr Michael Morbius. The CGI was so realistic it *felt* real! It felt like I was watching these events unfold in front of me in real life! Not to mention the dialogue, and what good Morbius review goes without praise for Morbius' signature catchphrase \"It's Morbin' Time\". When you hear that the first time, you'll Morb yourself, and you will know what it feels like to meet God. It's worth watching this entire film for that single line of dialogue alone. And the end-credits scenes, are absolutely PERFECT. I don't wanna spoil their greatness, but they tie Morbius into literally every movie ever made, and beautifully sets up Morbius 2: More Bius.Once again, I realize that my 10/10 rating is really underselling this movie, and I apologize greatly to any fellow Morbies that are offended by this low rating.",

Some love it for its more dark delivery and darker comedy. I actually enjoy what Sony is doing by making movies for the more vicious anti heroes while making them grounded for the most part. The MCU rarely touches on those important details. Morbius is very much like the first venom in its set up. Gives a nice origin story with some intriguing body horror and more gruesome than normal imagery for a comic book film. Definitely has some scattered plot pieces but it's serviceable. Also leaves more room for expansion in the world if the Sonyverse. Leto was great imo and still proves he's a fantastic actor. Visuals are very effective and vibrant. Overall the film is what I expected and it was solid.",

It does add an entertaining adaptation bringing in another character that is supposedly a Spider man villain. May not be as fun as the Venom movies. Jared Leto does a great job playing a sick Dr. Michael Morbius. Who is on a desperate search for a cure from his blood borne illness. Which one will be leading him into becoming a vampire. Adria Arjona also did great playing his love interest. Matt Smith is a bit flat with his character and also playing a villain that is one dimensional and forgettable. Jared Harris playing as Morbius mentor is also thin with his character. Along with Tyrese Gibson which the script did not give these characters anything more besides be on the hunt for Morbius.The film is very fast paced. And the script does not give much character development with any of the supporting characters besides Michael and Martine (Adria Arjona). The plot is thin and may not be as strong. The action sequences were okay. With the fast movements with the characters and editing which makes the scenes more of a chore to see than increase the entertainment value.If your looking for a quick superhero escapism in the theatres this film will be great. The direction did not do anything new to make it stand out compared to any other superhero films. There is a mid credit scene to give you a hint on where this character will be placed in the universe. The film is not great but still delivers some entertainment.",

Him and his childhood friend do their best to cope with being on their death bed. When the doctor has a breakthrough he discovers the cure is as much a curse as a gift...that doesn't prevent his friend from wanting a taste. Can Morbius find a way to save him and his friend and modify his cure or will his friend get his hands on the cure and cause all new problems?This movie is directed by Daniel Espinosa (Safe House) and stars Jared Leto (Requiem for a Dream), Matt Smith (The Crown), Jared Harris (Mad Men), Adria Arjona (Pacific Rim: Uprising), Tyrese Gibson (Baby Boy) and Al Madrigal (The Way Back).The storyline for this picture is very well told with great character backstories and evolution. You can easily find yourself rooting and relating to both the good and bad guy. The action scenes are excellent and very well done. The opening boat scene really sets the tone for the movie. I liked the \"smoke\" effects around the characters and there's lots of solid kill sequences and use of blood. I did wish they kicked the gore up another level but that's more of a preference, especially when there's so many kills. I'd also say I wasn't a huge fan of how the ending was executed in the final fight. They did do a good job of tying in the multiverse to keep you aligned on when and where this takes place.Overall this is not a great addition to the marvel universe but it is an entertaining one, much like the Venom movies. I would score this a 7/10 and recommend seeing it once.",

Matt Smith is undoubtedly the standout, completely over the top and clearly enjoying it.The CG is extremely messy and distracting, especially in the final fight which is almost completely incomprehensible. The action overall is competently shot but lacks any real weight or impact, made worse by a lack of blood and over relicance on slow motion.",

Michael Morbius is in the process of curing his rare blood disorder when he unleashes something even more life threatening, but not to himself.This film is bad there is no sugar coating it, but I believe it's watchable. I say it's watchable because I can appreciate the simplicity and the combination of horror and marvel but what makes this movie bad is the lack of development. The film just moves from plot point to plot point without any character development. The plot moves quick and thats good but if you don't develop your characters the plot doesn't matter.The lead character in this film has very little development and it keeps him from being a compelling character. A lot of the scenes in this film feel like they were cut, as if they finished the scene and decided they didn't like it so they cut it down. Jared Leto is good as Morbius but without the development it doesn't matter.This lack of character development is not just for Michael Morbius it's for the entire cast. Which really sucks because I think Matt Smiths character Milo could've been really great. The performance by Matt was very enjoyable but there was far too little of him.They also have added a romantic relationship which again might've been good if they developed it more.There are quite a few emotional moments in this film but none of them are actually emotional and that is because the movie doesn't make the audience care.Overall this film is bad. With zero development, the film doesn't allow you to care about any of the characters involved. Without that character development it's hard to be invested in the plot.3.5/10.",

    "text": "By any means this is not a good movie with interesting story and well-written characters. It's hard to determine, but maybe \"Morbius\" won the prize for the weakest film in SSU (Sony's Universe) and honestly it does with ease.Leto is \"okay\" in the role of Michael Morbius, the problem is that the role itself is not very well written. Matt Smith is the one who had the most fun with his role, everyone else is just there.The story is exactly what you expect to see - 90% similar to the previous two \"Venom\" movies, so there is no big mystery to unravel.The effects are pretty...how to say it...for the most part bad for a comicbook movie in 2022. Let's not forget that this movie was supposed to come out in 2020, initially before \"No Way Home\". However, I'm not sure that the people who worked on it did their job in the extra 2 years time, because...well I'll leave that to you.The main reason someone to be interested in this film is to understand how everything connects, given the easter eggs from the trailers. Well, don't expect too much, because you'll be disappointed.Morbius is another interesting character, who does not need a solo movie, only to be presented properly. Unfortunately, Sony again has surpassed themselves even after they squandered so much opportunities with the \"Venom\" movies. Honestly, I don't have high hopes for neither \"Kraven\" or \"Madame Web\". The standard is pretty low.The film is mediocre and feels like something straight from 2006, with some nasty effects and overall made just to make some dollars. Pitty. Disgrace to the character.I can say that the best...or rather the stupidest they have left for the end. I mean the credit scenes will make you shake your head and laugh.",

    "rating": 3,
    "date": "2022-04-03",
    "text": "\"Morbius\" is a superhero film based on the Marvel comic book character of the same name. Starring Jared Leto in the title role, it is one of the dullest, most boring superhero-related movies to be released in the past fifteen years.Since birth, Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) has lived a life of constant physical pain due to a rare blood disease impeding his movement. As a doctor, Michael uses his medical knowledge to create a special kind of artificial blood filled with the genetic material of vampire bats in an effort to find a cure for both himself and others. After taking a sample of the cure, Michael's health improves significantly but soon he starts to display symptoms of superhuman vampirism, killing many people and draining their blood for sustenance in the process.I have no idea what Sony Pictures thinks they're doing with their Marvel properties. One minute it seems they want to keep everything to themselves with standalone films and the next they want to collaborate alongside Disney's Marvel Cinematic Universe with Spider-Man. All these strange eschewed timelines make for confusing viewing for casual audiences and fans who cannot make heads or tails of where each of these films fit into which canon storyline. Like the two \"Venom\" films before it, \"Morbius\" is another attempt by Sony to introduce a Spider-Man villain by giving them their own solo film but it fails in practically every way possible.Once again, this film has fallen victim to the dreaded PG-13 rating handicap. This is especially frustrating since the main character is a vampire, a legendary creature who drinks the blood of the living for nourishment. Scenes that could have left a visceral impact on the viewer have clearly been watered down to fit the confines of its assigned rating. For example, whenever Morbius picks up someone and sink his fangs into their neck, the camera cuts away before we can be shown any gory detail. If the film were R rated, this could have been a great opportunity to demonstrate the horrific powers the main character has acquired by showing the bloody aftermath from the destruction they are causing. Instead, all these moments were merely implied or glossed over.Another thing that bothered me greatly was how unnecessarily dark the film was. No, I don't mean dark as in thematically, I mean the literally dark screen. Half the time I was squinting during the action scenes just to make out what was even happening. For moments that are inside Morbius's laboratory, it made sense for it to be dark but why did the filmmakers decide to use that exact same dim tinting during parts set outside in broad daylight? I get that he's technically a vampire and that he has an aversion to sunlight but not every single scene in the movie needs to reflect this. In a good movie like \"The Batman\", darkness is used as a storytelling element to show how the hero uses it to his advantage to hunt down his enemies. In a bad movie like this one, it only hampers the entire visual experience, making it very ugly to look at.The film also has some of the worst editing I've ever seen in a superhero movie. Everything is so chaotically paced it's near impossible to become invested in anything long term. Yet despite its breakneck speed and relatively short runtime (104 minutes), the film is surprisingly boring most of the way through. Perhaps it's the overall lack of interesting moments or the underdeveloped characters but nothing in this film left any major impression on me. It's a shame because I like the idea of a character like Morbius gaining his vampiric powers through genetic engineering instead of via the supernatural because it could have made for a more interesting exploration into potentially introducing vampires into a new Marvel timeline. But instead all we get from it is a few brief moments of exposition intercut with an arbitrary action scene saturated by a dark screen where it's hard to see anything. To add insult to injury, most of the action contains \"shaky-cam\" which makes an already badly shot movie look even more badly shot.I can't help but feel sorry for poor Jared Leto. He just doesn't seem to have much luck when it comes to appearing in superhero films. His version of the Joker in the DC Extended Universe is one many would rather forget (save for his scene in Zack Snyder's Justice League) and now I'm sure many would prefer to overlook his take on Morbius as well. To Leto's credit though, he at least looks like he's trying his best with the terrible material he has to work with, which is a task easier said than done. Sadly, there's not much here worth salvaging, as the script he has to work with is dead on arrival.Another actor who goes to waste along with him is Matt Smith as the antagonist Milo. Like Leto, Smith is also working hard to bring out as much entertainment value from his character as he can, but he is constantly bogged down by the film's worst traits. In the brief moments Leto and Smith were interacting, I could feel that there was some fleeting chemistry between them that could have made for some great dialogue scenes. But I guess the filmmakers thought the audience wouldn't care and decided to insert more badly shot and edited action scenes to pad things out.Even with my low expectations, \"Morbius\" still managed to disappoint me even more than I had imagined. Worst of all, the film isn't even bad in the cheesy fun sense; it's just a boringly forgettable experience. All the potential was there for them to have made at least a semi-decent origin story surrounding this character but without focus and passion (you know, the most important things required to tell a story in the first place) it all fell apart embarrassingly. The film is already failing both critically and commercially so hopefully this will serve as a wakeup call to the people at Sony. If you want to watch good Marvel movies featuring vampires, then watch the first two \"Blade\" films starring Wesley Snipes as they still hold up pretty well today (don't bother too much with \"Trinity\" though). As for this one, if you value your time and money, avoid it at all costs.I rate it 3/10.",

Except with terrible action scenes that you can't make out for all the bats and rubble that are in the way. As well as repetitive use of annoying slow motion, and people's faces quickly morphing into a Vampire face mid sentance. Just to remind you that the film isn't boring. There's even a forced unnecessary romance in there for no reason.It could of at least been average and is almost saved by the decent villian. But then there's those tacked on midcredit scenes that just remind you this is all one big con to get you back into the cinema next time.

NO. Is it good? Well, no. But it's okay. To go to the extreme that this movie is the second coming of Fantastic Four (2015) is an extreme to me, and If you disagree, you are entitled to your opinion, but I will just advise you to go rewatch it again.Morbius is a cool little movie, that I see as a bigger risk than any of the previous spider-man related projects it has dropped, while I, being a comic reader for most of my life wasn't jumping for joy when it was announced, I threw my respect for trying it at least. The product was what I pretty much expected; the films' story does what it can with what very little it has to work with, it's not groundbreaking, but I will say I was able to look through it's basic dialogue, and story errors to see great performances from both leads (Leto, Smith) The CGI, I believe was worth my price of admission, and I RARELY mention that as a positive on any review, I was pretty impressed and had no reason to be. The action scenes are really cool, have some fascinating shots, and feel somehow immersive, leaving me with this feeling like I almost was there seeing him experience some of the beauty in some powers. There are a few moments that story wise you will scratch your head or ask yourself if you missed something & I believe I fault that on the runtime and I also question what may have been left on the cutting room floor as I had noticed a couple of scenes from the trailer missing from this movie, which I really hope didn't happen but I understand this is a typical studio decision, even though 2 hours is average for a blockbuster. An additional, and final criticism I do share with some is that this absolutely should've been rated R, no question about it, and it probably would've hit better, but then again the budget cut would've probably gave us worse looking CGI.At the end of the day, check it out if you're thinking about it, if you're on the fence, just don't.The real lesson is...

    "text": "Never really been much of a \"Marvel\" fan more of a \"D. C.\" buff still anything with a horror twist or spin of an antihero had me to check it out and \"Morbius\" fit that bill. The character who first made his appearance in \"Spiderman\" comics, then later had his own series run, and with this film starring Jared Leto is nothing great, still it's a watch for comics and vampire fans. Jared Leto is Michael Morbius a biochemist who is always working on the latest medical discoveries and ,all of a sudden his life changes when he is affected by some rare blood. Now we see a man with fangs and claws and a guy with super special powers! Overall okay marvel comics film hopefully they can make sequels and have the \"Morbius\" character appear more in the \"Marvel\" universe world of movies.",

Fun action sequences, good atmosphere for its genre and characters, but again, it's very... basic.The conflict is very predictable and overused. Somehow the runtime is too long for what the storyline trying to tell, with that being said, weirdly some moments still felt rushed.No actual character development, no memorable hero moments. The cinematography is done well, Jared Leto's acting is great, I just hope it was written better, both the dialogue and storyline.But then again, with Morbius has a possible appearance in future Marvel Movie, especially in MCU, I'm still intrigued and excited.",

The few things to highlight are some performances and some slow-motion scenes, although these have spent a big part of the budget and do not add much to the plot or to the visual aspect.It is another movie that shows that vampire movies have no salvation or redemption, it is totally forgettable, not even the post credits scene could save it.",

Which is odd, given how well they stared out the gate with Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2.But since those two, they haven't been able to find a film that has completely knocked it out of the park, without Marvel Studios involvement. The Amazing Spider-Man had good bits, and Venom was fun, but Morbius experience came across as a chore.I thought Jared Leto wasn't bad, and actually held himself back a bit (unlike say Tom Hardy who went all out with Venom). Matt Smith looked like he was having fun also.Visuals were patchy, but had some interesting parts. While the end credit scenes detracted from an already disappointing story.Sony, don't miss you chances. You may only have one left.",

This movie is about a sick person who is looking for a cure for his illness. I can reveal that it's about bats and their strength. Morbius is a character from the world of Spider-Man and is a villain in it. In this movie, however, he is shown to be good-natured. The CGI did a very good job and it really looks like the titular character is swinging around in the world of the movie. Space was even made for love.I have to say Spider-Man movies and everything that has to do with him interests me a lot. In my opinion, this movie is very well done and a lot of fun.

Leto is joined by the great Matt Smith as his best friend.I really did enjoy the whole movie, I thought the acting was good, the visual effects were incredible and I just felt like everything linked up the way it should of and I have a theory why its so disliked, this is an underrated Marvel character that not many are aware of, he's not woke and that's a problem these days.

    "text": "The Make Up/Effects at Points:\nWhen they are investing and putting effort into the movie, the effects are not bad in Morbius. While not really achieving what Disney has perfected, there are times where the pale, emaciated figure of Morbius is rather shocking to see and I applaud the ability to make his disease look realistic. Once the vampiric powers start to arise, there are times where the effects are looking pretty cool, and hold some edge of cool for me in the way they designed the transformation features. Seeing his eyes transform into this blind like state was my particular fate, but other eye color changes, the warping of the face at times, and even the cool finger effects of his claws were elements I thought were done well for this film. It's again not the most unique or jaw dropping experience we've ever seen, but it works for me.The Special Effects:\nAgain, there is a lot of room for improvement, but at times Morbius manages to shake some things up for using technology to make some moments pretty cool. At the lower level of likes is the dash like speed force he has, managing to be actually fast, but not too slow-motion madness like Snyder likes. As more powers arise, there are some cool moments that help make you feel like you are in for the ride (like a virtual coaster), and the sonar is pretty cool in those opening moments. My favorite involves the use of critters, and the nice use of lighting and sound effects to really give you that element of dread, darkness and superhero abilities that we love to hear/see in the theater.The First Part of the Story:\nThere is a nice opening to this movie as the first act unfolds for Morbius' place in this crazy mixed up universe. A nice touching moment between the two main characters, some engaging medical drama moments that match other searches for the cure, and some other set ups got points for engagement for me in this film. If only that quality could have been kept for much of the film, but that opening showed great promise for this series.The First Action Scene:\nIt's not the most put together scene, but I did like the angle they took with the first fight on the boat. Morbius' dive into his powers leads to a predator like moment that held some dynamic angles and approaches to taking on the extras. A few first-person moments, mixed with fleeting glimpses of him in the shadows felt like a hardcore Batman Begins scene that works with this savage nature of Morbius' tale. It showed promise for the rest of the film, but that did not quite pan out.The Acting:\nIt's not the best by far, but there were moments where the actors were able to salvage some of the movie with performances that could have been capitalized on. Ariona is stunning on many levels, a combination of beauty, smarts, and spirit that makes for a more interesting supporting character for this film. She held a lot of the logic and goodness of the city, but always had the ability to challenge the rules that made her perfect to help with Morbius' plans. I'm going to skip over the other top billed actor due to their low involvement, but Matt Smith as Milo had moments that would have worked had they reigned some of the writing back. Smith's non intense moments do have some heart to it, and that first act again shows the promise of a complicated character. When he is forced to go to other extremes, there are times his mannerisms are perfect for the role, and other times a little too much. Still, I enjoyed the performance he brought to some degree. Leto is of course the star of the film, and he tried to do as much as he could with what he was given. Leto's first act is strong, and his second act is not bad, but there is just some missing direction or planning that gets lost to the weaknesses of the movie. Overall, there is some decent and good chemistry, but it's lost to a lot of other things in this movie.DISLIKES:The Weaker Acting Moments:\nI never expect Oscar roles in these movies, but I've had enough quality to know stronger acting roles in a superhero movie. Morbius has a lot of shorthanded acting moments, many being cheesy, flat, or just ludicrous with the material given. As the movie progressed, the acting quality continued to worsen until it was just a messy finish that was humorous at times and lacking on others.The Writing:\nI don't know what's up with the dialogue, but the movie's quality in lines also degrades over time. That strong start, engaging dialogue with realism and panache are practically absent at the end, and things just become very simplified and cut to be almost not needed by the end of the film. Other lines and attempts to be clever find their marks, but most are straight misses for this reviewer, lost to all the over-the-top visuals and lackluster second and third acts that have too much in them.The Comedy:\nIs very limited for me to be honest. The movie's jokes have become stale from the multiple trailers that they have very little bite to them unless you have missed those trailers. Other jokes are very forced on you, and for me (and most of my audience members) did not generate too many intentional laughs. I hate to say that, but I just did not laugh as much as I have at other superhero movies in this film.The Action:\nSony used to be awesome with their superhero action, giving me those high-flying Spiderman moments that to this day still get me stoked for what they did. However, Morbius' darker atmosphere offered some chances to tear into the fighting again as he explored the nature of his powers. While some of these effects did accomplish this, much of the action was lame for me, quick bouts of overexaggerated moves that were over before they started. No coordination, no titanic displays of powers, just a few quick blurs into slow motion snarls don't make for the most entertaining battles for me. Throw some choreography, a bit of fun moves, and some other tropes and this could have worked. And as a plus, drop the Snydervision antics down a peg if possible.The Visual Effects: The Other side:\nSome things look awesome and others are showing the limitations of Sony's group and the impact on budgets. I can't say it's the worst, because they can still do better than me, but the cheesy visuals dilute the vampiric mode they were striving to design. During the creature moments, prosthetics could have helped with this, while also tightening up the CGI to not look so fake and artificial. It's nothing that destroys the movie for the most part, but Disney again has proven their merit in this element.The Story:\nThis is the weakest element of the movie for me, and the part that I think weakness many of the other elements mentioned above. Morbius' first act actually is not bad, a little predictable, a few extra cut moments, but sets the stage for ethical dilemmas that will be tested in the coming hour and a half. And then comes the second act where suddenly things pick up pace, lots of elements are pushed in, action scenes get muddy, and build up/testing is rather low, dropping all that preparation. The movie tries to fight quality and speed at this point, and the thing that suffers is suspense and character utilization, which is very poor in this movie. Big name actors, and roles get various levels of showing up on screen, most of which feel very weak to the promise being made. Once the third act hits... the movie is rushing to not only wrap up this chapter with an \"exciting\" climax, but also set up for the next movie if they get greenlit. Unfortunately, this failed miserably for me and felt like a sweep under the rug. Unlike Venom, the after credits scene could not redeem the ending, and even these scenes don't quite make sense or have the punch I think was envisioned. Had the story been balanced and not as much crammed in, perhaps all these dislikes would be likes.The VERDICT:\nMorbius is indeed one of the weaker installments of the Marvel series, and it all comes down to planning, writing and balance, which this movie lacks. Sure, there are moments that do work for me, the first act in particular being the strongest part, alongside some effects and fighting do work for me. The acting does its best with the material, but it can only do so much with what it was given, which is not much at times. Where the movie fails though is that the visual effects are lacking at times, alongside mundane action sequences that utilize little of the imagination Sony once held for their hero flicks. It's really the writing and story though that just have everything collapse, a rush mess that seemed to take hits with each delay, including the hasty wrap up and teasers that they are trying to lure you back in with for the sequel that may come. It's too much in one movie and it really pales in comparison to a lot of other things in this category. Thus, the effects may be the only worthy theater visit quality, while I give a strong nod to seeing this at home if you can.My scores are:Action/Adventure/Horror: 5.5\nMovie Overall: 4.0-4.5.",

    "text": "Dr. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto), the title character of Columbia Pictures' MCU-adjacent semi-horror movie \"Morbius,\" is a \"living vampire.\" What, you might be thinking, does that mean? Did the good doctor become a vampire without having to die first? Why, yes-he fused his DNA with vampire bat DNA in an attempt to cure the rare, fatal blood disease that's been plaguing him since childhood. (What disease, you ask? You sweet, innocent child.) The fusion gave him super speed, super strength, echolocation abilities, and an appetite for blood that's only partially sated by the artificial substitute for which Morbius rejects a Nobel Prize at the beginning of the film. (Why? Again, you're asking too many questions.) In short, he's a science vampire. (So, like if Batman was a doctor, then? Wrong universe, but close.)So that means the usual rules of vampirism don't apply, right? Yes and no. Loxias Crown (Matt Smith) Morbius' best friend turned greatest adversary, does turn himself into a vampire using Morbius' formula. But we don't know if he died in the process. That sequence is left off screen, for reasons presumably tied to the many reshoots and delays that hampered \"Morbius\" on its journey to the big screen. Enjoy the gasp as it escapes from your throat, dear viewer. Because you're not going to get another one, at least not from this movie. Better luck next time with the actual undead, we suppose.\"Morbius\" is available only in theaters on April 1.",

    "text": "It has been a long time since I read the Morbius comics but I believe they did a decent job. The look of Morbius was pretty good except I could have sworn his was whiter. I also do not remember him having the power to control bats.The issue with origin stories is either they do not have enough time to spin it up or they don't have enough time for the action parts. This movie tried to balance the two and missed the mark by a little. It's not a huge miss but I would have liked to see more of the beginning and definitely more of the action. And it was clear who was going to be the bad guy right from the start. Not a huge deal but not a surprise when it was revealed.What I didn't like was the smokey colors that trailed after them when they were \"moving fast\". I guess that was there was to highlight they were fast moving. It's certainly not that they become misty when moving or at least I do not remember that.My one big issue that will be mainly for the part 2. Is Morbius' bite could make other people become pseudo vamps like him without his powers. They did not indicate this happened to any of the previous victims. Only one of them woke up and if they try and make that person powerful that will be a big let down. In fact, the origin of that one would be different than the original origin of that character. But who knows...With the multiverse thing going on they could have had different stories that lined up with this.That's the real reason they did the multiverse...That way they can redo anything they want and say \"hey, it's not the same\". I guess it's better than time travel which allows them to change whatever they want. Take Star Trek for instance. I like the new movies but they threw in some time travel and can now recreate the whole Star Trek franchise and make changes whenever they want.",

He is a Nobel prizewinning chemist and a rebel.Morbius stumbles onto a cure by splicing his blood and genes with Costa Rican bats. It turns Morbius into super strong vampire monster with maniacal tendencies.The cure is unstable but when his friend Milo finds out about it, he takes the blood and is angry at Morbius for denying him the cure.The batty Morbius finds himself in the frame for various deaths.The movie is muddled. It has a flashback to 25 years ago at the beginning and never gets around to tell the audience that it is now back in the present.The ethical side effects of Morbius's experiments are never adequately explored.Both Leto and Smith are saddled with flat and hackneyed characterisation.The whole thing lacks energy and is only connected to the Spiderverse with the mid credit sequences at the end of the movie and that too was befuddling.",

I saw someone complain over studio interference, and if so that make sense and would explain the short run time and what feels like cut-off scenes.I have 3 major complaints about this movie.The first being what I already mention that the movie feels too short. I got the same feeling as when I was the original JL movie, you can tell that it was unnecessarily and weirdly cut down. Here it feels like the studio cut out 20 min or so. The second complaint I have is that the filming is too dark. I get it is bats, superheroes and things that hide in the dark, but you do not need to make everything muddy and unclear. The third objection I have is that this is very standard. They took no risks whatsoever. What you think this movie is, that is exactly what it is. This is almost as generic as BlackPanter was, and this movie follow almost the exact same pattern as that movie so without saying anything more you now know 95% of the plot of the movie just by reading this sentence. They could have taking this bloodier R-rating, or at least taken a few turns that is different to all other similar movies.With those things out of the way this is still decently entertaining. We got a bit spoiled with great superhero movies the past couple of decades so this is nothing special, but if this had been out in the 1990s it would likely been celebrated as one of the best superhero movies of all time. Morbius is definitely worth a watch and worth the movie ticket. You will not be bored, the acting is great, music and costumes spot on, CGi is mostly great (a few misses) and the movie has good dialogue and a good ending. I am not sure why people complain.I give this a 6/10, but I will upgrade to a 7/10 to offset all the negative reviews.",

It's about a biochemist named Michael Morbius who tries to cure himself of a rare blood disease, but instead, he inadvertently infects himself with a form of vampirism.It hurts my heart to give a Marvel movie a bad grade because I'm normally such a huge fan, but I just couldn't get into this one. It's directed by Daniel Espinosa and written by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless.Marvel is magic, but Sony didn't capture it this time around.THINGS I LIKED:\nI really like Jared Leto and am sincerely happy for him to be given this comic book character to bring to life. He's extremely talented and really works hard to introduce us to this interesting character.Matt Smith, Adria Arjona, Jared Harris, Tyrese Gibson, and Al Madrigal flesh out the cast and all do a fine job.The New York City scenes were actually filmed in Manchester, England. Weird, right? They had to change all of the street signs and license plates and could have saved some time if they had just filmed in the Big Apple. They also did that in the movie Captain America: The First Avenger.Marvel fans will be able to spot a lot of Easter eggs and tie-ins from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Watch Matt Smith's character carefully and you'll even spot some similarities to Jim Carrey's character in the movie The Mask.There are some cool special effects.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:\nThe plot wanders around. Snore. I just didn't care about the characters or the story.The constant beating score is heavy-handed and exhausting.There's some action, but mostly a lot of smoldering anger and talking.Lots of CGI and not much we haven't already seen a million times before.So much exposition.The characters are thin and underdeveloped.Spiderman? Venom? They both capture the whimsical humor needed to balance out the serious drama. Morbius completely forgot about that successful formula.The movie isn't that long but feels like it. I was bored within minutes.The fighting and action scenes are just a big jumbled mess so that you can't really see what's happening.TIPS FOR PARENTS:\nIt feels more like a horror movie and is very dark for kids\nBlood\nBullying\nViolence\nYou see a mouse die.Science\nDestruction\nInnocent people die\nScary vampire faces\nSooo much angerTHEMES:\nSpecial gifts\nBeing \"normal\"\nVampires\nFriendship and loyalty\nHelping othersYou can see my full review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel.",

It will pay dividends in the end. Some would even suggest they make better movies than the Disney marvel.Don't believe the critics. This one is a must for the fans.",

    "text": "I have been a fan of Marvel films since I was a kid and I always try to look for the good in them first, simply because I don't enjoy disliking them. When a superhero story is told very well, they're some of my favourite stories out there. When Sony began to branch out their Spider-Man universe and make villain films, I was very worried. I had some fun with both Venom films, but neither were great by any means. Well, the latest Sony/Marvel villain film, Morbius, has just hit the big screen, and it's not good, which is saying a lot coming from me.Trying to cure himself of a rare condition, Dr. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) discovers that there may be a cure hidden in the blood of bats. After injecting himself to find out, he morphs himself into some kind of vampire. From here, he begins to lose control, creating casualties along the way. His best friend Milo (Matt Smith) also has this condition, so I'm sure you can guess where the villain storyline comes into play here. So now that you have the just of the premise, let's dive in.Firstly, I'm not going to ignore the elements that worked for me overall. I'll admit that this is the best I've seen from Jared Leto in a while and the chemistry he shared with Martine (Adria Arjona) was absolutely a highlight of the film. The tone suits what's going on and I enjoyed the look of it overall, but the tone and slow pacing eventually grind the film to a halt on a few occasions. I'm also all for a darker hero/anti-hero story in the Marvel universe because we haven't had much of that, but there just wasn't enough of a good story being told to back that up. There was an effort here, it just didn't work for me.So, why didn't this film work? Well, I was instantly turned off by the first scene, as the discovery of the bats is literally the opening sequence. Just a couple of scenes later he's already injecting himself and the cure begins to work. It's almost like the first act of the film was condensed to five minutes. Moving along, there are many scenes of dialogue that drag on, while the important plot points seem to be brushed over as bullet points. Morbius is so focused on getting to the good stuff, but it's sacrificing its characters in the process. On top of not really caring about what was going on, the finale just felt like another CGI fight that lasts for about 20 minutes. Those sequences can be tolerable or even great if they're part of a good film, but I just found myself rolling my eyes this time.In the end, Morbius is a film that takes place in the same world as Venom (maybe?) and Spider-Man (maybe?), but I was too confused with the conclusion of the film to really know where it takes place. I'd almost say it takes place in its own world. Morbius is a movie that clearly feels tampered with in post-production, and not in a good way. I do like Jared Leto as this character so I will gladly sit through a film that includes him, but I really don't care to see a series of films based solely on Morbius. Once the credits rolled I had no desire to recommend it to anyone and I can't see myself revisiting it, unless necessary. Morbius, even with low expectations on my part, sadly disappointed me.",

    "text": "You'd think from some of the reviews I've seen this was the worst thing ever made. Was it an amazing film and a good addition to marvel? No. But, it's not horrendous either. It has some glaringly obvious issues when you watch and the plot felt a bit soulless. But it could have been much much worse!What's the issues? For me the main annoyance I had was the writing of the film. It just seemed so disjointed at times and almost rushed. It felt like someone went \"write a marvel film you have a week\" and this is the product. The final half an hour or so really illustrated this as it felt like it would almost skip parts (won't give examples due to spoilers) and certain actions weren't explained. I feel like they needed to flesh out the plot a bit more and with it being a short film, they could have done this easily.The characters. So actually the base set of characters on face value is absolutely fine. But the chemistry between them just wasn't there. Distinct lack of character depth as well didn't help either. The romance side of the plot made absolutely zero sense and came from nowhere as there was absolutely no sexual chemistry or anything even hinting to it. The actual villain played by fellow Rovers fan Matt Smith needed more depth. He kind of just becomes a villain for no reason. Give us more! Just became hard to root for anyone really.Little niggles I want to mention. I wanted the fight scenes to be a little better. Was quite hard to see what was actually happening because it was that fast and there wasn't enough of it either. The film is basically 95% shot in the dark, which from an audience point of view it got annoying.So yeah, for me that's Morbius' biggest issues and I think what's annoyed me more is that this could have been amazing, but just fell so flat. Like it's not the worst film you'll see by any stretch, but I left feeling dissatisfied. It's average at the end of the day and that's why I'm going 5/10.",

    "text": "Morbius (2022) :\nMovie Review -Marvel means superhero. But is it completely true? Can Marvel be something different too? Yes, it can be. Can it be something related to vampires? Yes. Here's Morbius to give you all the answers. You see, this concept of failed experiments (of scientists or doctors) or side effects of experiments is way too old in Hollywood. James Whale made some iconic films like Frankenstein (1931), \"The Invisible Man\" (1933) and \"Bride of Frankenstein\" (1935) with this formula in the horror genre. George Waggner followed Whale's footprints and made \"The Wolf Man\" (1941).Those early experiments were shocking to the audience in that era because Hollywood was establishing new genres then. But the same stuff became old and cliched with films like \"Hallow Man\" (2000), \"Spider Man\" (2002), \"Hulk\" (2003) and a few others. Some films used the formula of a failed experiment to show the good guys, while some used it for the bad ones. Spider Man 3 came with that Venom thing, which showed us two characters being haunted by the same supernatural power, and recently we saw a Malayalam superhero flick, \"Minnal Murali,\" (2021) with the same thought. Marvel's Morbius is quite similar to these two films. But it has a damn boring plot and a predictable twist that just doesn't survive.In the film, Dr. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) tries to cure himself of a rare blood disease with the help of his girlfriend and fellow doctor, Martine (Adria Arjona), but he inadvertently infects himself with a form of vampirism instead. He is blessed with enormous powers, but he doesn't know how to control them. Is it a gift or a curse? His surrogate brother, Milo (Matt Smith), shows him the other side of this new invention, which creates differences between them. Who will win in the end? A good vampire or an evil one? The second half of Morbius provides you with all the answers, and believe me, there is nothing unpredictable or new here.Marvel films are usually not dark, but this one is an exception. I don't need to explain what happens when Marvel tries something dark and intense. The fans don't expect them to make such films. They just want entertainment and larger-than-life characters with screaming heroic acts, not a story. With Morbius, Marvel fans get neither of them. Morbius is not a superhero film, actually. It just ends up being a superhero flick, somehow. A vampire drama is nothing new for us. From \"The Golem\" (1920), \"Nosferatu\" (1922), \"Dracula\" (1931), and many other well-known horror films and TV shows (in every industry across the world), the idea just doesn't change. Then how can Morbius be an exception? It just happens to be dropped in the wrong universe and at the wrong time, that's all.Jared Leto has been impressive in the last 5-6 years, with some good acting credits to his name. So, Morbius was a simple task for him because VFX did the majority of the work for him. Well, this is not just the acting-driven role he deserves, but he's fine with whatever acting-loaded scenes he has got. Matt Smith is surprising, though. His character comes as a surprise, and that's still digestible, I should say, but his performance too comes as a surprise, and that's a pleasant surprise, I must say. The gorgeous looking Adria Arjona hasn't got too many long scenes, but whenever she appears, she makes sure that you notice her presence. Jared Harris, Al Madrigal, and Tyrese Gibson's support is strictly okay.Morbius is full of colourful visuals. It looks unnecessary and illogical as the colour themes and that foggy smoke behind the vampires don't really make any sense, but don't know why, the screen appeal carries it through. It doesn't bore, and that's too much, but the screenplay does. Also, the fighting scenes are shot from close angles - putting a lot of strain on your eyes for some time. Nevertheless, a few of them are brilliantly shot, and indeed, they entertain you. However, a little more practical sense would have only helped.Morbius' mediocrity is not limited to the writing, but also reflects on Daniel Espinosa's outdated vision. Come on man, I mean, it's 2022, not 1982 to show so much repetitiveness on screen. Espinosa's directional techniques drain all the blood out of Morbius' body. Somehow, the soul survives due to Marvel's comic tale. Rest, it's a strictly below-average show saved by some breathtaking action sequences and somewhat pleasant visual effects. Don't expect anything more than that, not even a penny, because if you do, Morbius will suck all your blood during those 106 minutes. Overall, an underwhelming Gothic tale with uneven Marvel stamping all over. SKIP IT!RATING - 4/10*",

    "text": "Morbius Review-\nMinor SpoilersPros:\n1. Entertaining. This film is only 1 hour and 44 minutes long and goes by pretty fast. The first half of the movie is definitely better than the rest. I was surprised it actually has some cool parts and Dr. Michael Morbius is a kind-hearted person deep down and has elements that reminded me of Eddie Brock. I definitely need an oversized pajama shirt of Morbius's scary face on it now! His character I think has potential.2. Martine Bancroft. The main female character Dr. Martine Bancroft is a colleague of Dr. Morbius and in the comics becomes his fianc\u00e9. She brings cool female touch to the horror of this movie, I ended up liking her character.In comparison to Venom's Anne Weying (Michelle Williams) Martine (Adria Arjona) is a cooler better supporting character and a lot more loyal. Okay yes and she also has a cat (which Morbius lets hang around).3. The 2 mid credit scenes. The theater that I was in, like smart Marvel fans, stayed around for the credits and it was the moment that people cheered. I won't go into details with what they were but it was awesome! It definitely is part of the other Marvel universes.Cons:\n1. The villain. Matt Smith who is supposedly a good actor in other films SUCKED in this (no pun intended). In my personal opinion he is what dragged this movie down. Jared Leto is apparently a better actor than Matt Smith, at least in this film. His character Milo has a scene that is about as cringeworthy as Venom dancing in the club in Let there be Carnage.2. A lot of CGI. There are a lot of scenes of CGI and fight scenes that kind of make the movie lame because of the floating weird aura around them as they move. When Dr. Morbius goes full vampire, as he looks in the photo, he looks super creepy and awesome but most of the time him and his villain don't look that cool, and of course very fake.3. Some things didn't add up. I was a little bit confused as to how his origin begins. There is a scene where Dr. Michael is standing in front of the bat cave with his bloody hand out, but then another seen where he's injecting himself with the \"cure\". It took me a minute to realize which one happened first and then later. Also there's another scene which I didn't like regarding him and Martine (I won't go into details for spoilers) but I understood it later. There were some scenes that definitely needed help.If you love dark perfect-for-Halloween type films you will enjoy this. It has its moments where it's like Venom, but not as cool or endearing. If you pass on it I understand, it's not Marvel's best, but for the Marvel boys, go judge it for yourself.For the record, Jared Leto is not in any way like the Joker at all in this movie. It lacks a lot but for a Halloween movie it's cool. 6.5/10.",

    "text": "This movie was a disappointment, because it could have been great. However, it's not as bad as the reviews suggest. The story was interesting for the first half and turned into a hot mess for the second half. I could have also done without so much of the CGI because that diminished the film and made it feel \"cheaper\". I would have preferred prosthetics instead of the CGI faces because they looked really good for the first half, then turned so obviously fake by the second half, it was laughable. The CGI \"blurriness\" when the vampires would move looked terrible. I know it was suppose to represent the bat radar, but it was distracting. I also thought the detectives were pretty pointless to the story and could have been written to make some type of contribution for the climax of the movie. It needed to be darker to work, with a tone like \"The Batman\". However, the actors, especially Leto, did a good job for what they were working with. It wasn't terrible, just wasn't good.",

    "text": "You wanted an action, adventure, horror, sci-fi, thriller then look no further than \"Morbius\" as it tries to tick all those boxes.Sometimes it tries a little too hard.You wait almost one third of the screening before you even see the vampirism of \"Morbius\".One of the most adaptable, versatile, chameleons of this current generation of actors, Jared Leto, plays the award winning scientist \"Dr Michael Morbius\", famous for inventing artificial blood and saving countless lives through his work in the laboratory.Morbius lives with his own blood disorder, so his actions aren't entirely selfless.The cure he so desperately searches for through the experimental use of vampire bats will transform him into Count Dracula and his need for real blood will grow.Former Dr Who, Matt Smith, plays his lifelong buddy \"Milo\" who's from old money and is funding the good doctors research because it would also benefit his own health issues.There is one scene involving Milo lifted directly from \"The Usual Suspects\".Another wonderful British actor Jared Harris feels a bit wasted as \"Milos\" carer, \"Dr Emil Nicholas\".In fact, Marvel comic book fans are asking themselves of all the characters you could do a deep dive for why even choose \"Morbius\"?To be honest I've been looking forward to this screening for months because I'm an unabashed horror fan.I've been watching Hammer Horror Vampire films forever.However the horror elements (SFX/CGI) feel dated and not very scary, more designed for a younger audience.Al Madrigals' Agent Rodriguez, gives the viewer some comedy relief, which is mostly missing from this Sony movie.It felt like it was trying to be dark like DC's \"The Batman\" but didn't get even close to reaching those heights.Watch out for: 2 Easter Eggs during the end credits that give you a clue as to where the director, Daniel Espinosa, is trying to take this movie and any upcoming sequels.",

He befriends and protects the wealthy newcomer boy Lucien, calling his Milo. When Dr. Nicholas notes his high IQ, he sends Morbius to study in the USA. Twenty-five years later, Dr. Morbius (Jared Leto) becomes a scientist awarded with the Nobel Prize, but he continues his research with artificial blood that he has created with Dr. Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona) and financially supported by Milo (Matt Adams). When he feels that he will die soon, he decides to research vampire bats in international waters in a cargo vessel for ethical reasons. He prepares a serum and injects himself, turning into a monster and killing all the hired mercenaries on board that have threatened and injured Dr. Bancroft. Agent Simon Stroud (Tyrese Gibson) and Agent Rodriguez (Al Madrigal) investigate the weird case since the mercenary bodies have no blood. When Milo sees Morbius strong, he believes the experiment has succeeded, but Morbius refuses to give the serum to him and they fight each other. But soon Morbius finds that something very bad has happened.\"Morbius\" is an engaging adventure with a lead character that resembles a vampire. The screenplay develops the characters very well and holds the attention of the viewers. The special effects are excellent and adequately used. In the end, it is worthwhile watching \"Morbius\". My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): \"Morbius\"",

The movie's one saving grace is Matt Smith's hammy performance as he glees it up as the villainous Milo. The rest of the movie is one gigantic bore with Leto sleepwalking his way through the role. The last 20 minutes come and go with little fanfare as it looks like it has just been cobbled together at the last minute. There are 2 mid credit sequences but by the time they come, you won't care enough to have any interest in it whatsoever. Hopefully Jared Leto never meets Hardy or Holland.

    "text": "I'm not sure what the magic touch that Marvel has is, but whatever it is, it's certainly not rubbing off on Sony when they try and make a film without them. Two disappointing \"Venom\" films are followed by this one about Spider-man's Vampiric sometime foe, sometime friend that looked like a shaky proposition a long way out. That it's not as bad as some reviews have made out is about the best I can say.Having been born with a debilitating and life limiting blood condition, Doctor Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) has spend his life trying to find a cure. Coming to believe that the answer lies in the DNA of Vampire Bats, Morbius tests his experimental serum on himself. Though he is cured, even given superhuman abilities, his rational mind is only sated by the consumption of blood - human or synthetic. Struggling with his curse, he refuses to give the cure to his long-time friend and benefactor Milo (Matt Smith), but when he takes it anyway, Milo finds he has less qualms about taking a life.It's not awful, but it's not good either. Like it's \"Venom\" stablemates before it, it is a CGI heavy superhero film that feels behind the times. Not investing enough in the story of the film and assuming that brand name recognition and a tiny bit of spectacle will be enough to get people in. Leto's sleepwalks through the role a bit, though Matt Smith, and Jared Harris as their defacto father get a bit more to do. Tyrese Gibson and Al Madrigal appear as two special agents, but their contributions to the plot are so limited they could have been cut entirely. In fact, they do just disappear from the film after a while.To get slightly more specific about my problems with the plot, I feel like Morbius and Milo fall out too quickly, once they're both Vampires. That the romantic relationship was unearned and the less said about the post credits scenes and their baffling look into the future the better.I feel like Sony could do with a little more quality in their creative teams, maybe a few more gambles with types of directors and writers their choosing for their projects. (Or just knock it off and the Marvel do it).",

Pleasantly surprised, leave your biased opinions at home and just watch it for what it is and I'm sure you'll enjoy it. Big plus that it's under 2 hours so it didn't drag anything out. Great length, good action scenes and open ending. Nothing to complain about other than maybe I'd love a few more action scenes. Watching how the \"creature\" moves and fights is different from what I've seen in any other movie so would definitely have loved to see more of that.",

    "text": "It's pretty rare for me to see superhero movies with a great logical explanation for their superpower through sci-fi. This Morbius (2022) has a lil bit blown my mind with their scientific explanation and great delivery which is convincing enough to think if Morbius's superpower is possibly happening. One of the Greatest Scientists and a Nobel Prize Repellent, Dr. Michael Morbius struggle to find the cure for his incurable disease for his fellow sufferer. Then, he has found the cure through bat vampire blood with great superhuman power but costing uncontrollable body and mind. Long story short, this movie is about the introduction of Morbius's superpower and most of the storyline is about controlling his superpower.The pros are suitable pace which is not too fast or too slow, great logical explanation through a Lil bit of sci-fi, and a clear storyline through simple story explanation. My odd POV, I thought this movie a lil bit reminded me about the chars from The Twilight Saga, especially The Volturi. The Volturi char seems to have a similar appearance to Morbius through the same haircut and vampire ambiance lol. The cons are incomparable to other superhero movies and standard quality for overall including visual, ex: CGI. This movie didn't about a superhero typical plot in which superheroes fight the villain from a threatening world. It even didn't about fighting a very difficult or a very strong villain which makes this movie didn't qualify enough as a superhero movie. But both of that reason is typical of Sony Spider-Man Universe like Venom movies. This is also the main reason why Morbius has been made to synchronize with Spider-Man, Venom, and upcoming movie through the different universes of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) which consist of the Avengers.Overall, this movie is just good and okay. It's worth it if didn't expect any expectations of a superhero movie. Maybe it felt like Venom movies but tbh I'd rather choose Venom lol. Lastly, there are two post-credit and pretty important if wondered how the universe collides with the Spider-Man.",

    "text": "Why is Sony hiring B-grade inexperienced director and writers for blockbuster titles? This film had tons of room for improvement, particularly in its convoluted and lazy screenplay. There are scenes where things are happening, and we don't know how or why e.g. Leaning back and almost falling off the rooftop while getting caught amidst the unexplained sonic waves? Didn't any one person see these mistakes (even in editing) to make what I'm sure would be easy fixes? I'm not sure why the mid-credit scene was even needed, as it made the already incohesive story more incoherent. The premise of the story itself was excellent, too bad it became a wasted opportunity.Cinematography was decent, although the S/VFX could've been much better and more exciting. Sound and score were on point. The 104 min runtime flew by with the decent pacing, almost too much so, that I feel another 20-25 minutes of better experienced writing could've gone a long way in making this film much better. Casting and performances were great all around. Still, it's certainly not as bad as all the critics say it is, and I actually enjoyed it more than Pattinson as e.m.o. Batman. A well deserved 7/10 from me.",

Why would they get close to him in action and not show anything???Instead we get to see him fly around the city.The antagonist was a mess, he had no motivation, no background of being this evil guy he was portrayed as.He just woke up one day and chose violence.There were many insignificant side characters that added nothing to the story.",

He like a mere mortal put on this earth saw what even cosmic being couldn't interpret.Morbius changed my life. It opened my eyes to unknown secrets of life. The journey of Dr. Morbius is relatable and I could feel myself being him in those situations (of course when reality striked, I could never be him but it felt good to imagine being as great a person as Michael Morbius). If there were ever a renaissance to occur I believe this movie would start it, and arguably it already has.So it's no surprise it instantly became the highest grossing movie of all time in the span of just 1 month. Everything about this film is surreal and artistic. Don't make the mistake of thinking that just because it's a comic book movie is generic because it's far from it. I can attest that no comic book movie would ever come close to Morbius, not even The Dark Knight.One of the best scenes to ever grace the history cinema was Matt Smith's character, Milo, dance scene. It was encompassed almost everything that is right with 21st century cinema.Words fail me now to describe the art piece I witnessed. It's a shame we had to wait 3 years for Morbius to arrive because I think if it had come before pandemic, it would've stopped pandemic from ever occurring because Morbius puts the virus to shame. It would be afraid to ever infect a crowd of Morbius devotees. Praise Morbius.I don't read comics now, neither do I watch any other movie than Morbius. I have devoted my life to Morbius. Morbius you are and to Morbius you shall return.Stay Morbin.",

And it really isn't worth just 1 out of 10, that would mean the movie is utter crap, and it definitely isn't. People here are so extreme with their grades. I had a good time with this movie, the actors were good, I liked the story, the action and special effects were good...I just wish they could have shown us a little more. It felt like it was over too quickly. There could have been more to tell. For me, this was a solid 8. I liked it and would like to see it again, as is often the case for me when it comes to Marvel movies, since I'm a big Marvel fan. If you're not a Marvel fan, you can probably skip this movie. The bonus scenes don't really make any sense though...even if you've already seen the latest Spider-Man movie. Many plot holes there and just weird connections that doesn't really work.",

But, other than that, this movie is a sad and unfortunate embarrassment, especially to any key decision maker involved in its release.There was probably a sensible Morbius movie at some point but this movie is not it. This movie is a choppy mess. It's senseless, incoherent and disjointed, stitched together with questionable editing that'll leave viewers befuddled and utterly dissatisfied.I cannot believe Sony released this.",

    "text": "Morbius is a known Spider-Man villain and/or anti-hero in the comics, and now he has his own movie that is confusing for Marvel Spider-Man fans like myself.I'll start with positives. I liked Jared Leto as Michael Morbius and thought he gave a good performance, along with having some good effects on him and looking comic accurate when in vampire form.The abilities of Morbius were cool and how he used them were visually interesting. When there are scare scenes they do look scary if they are effective.Now my negatives. Matt Smith's performance in the movie can be over the top and weird seeing in a movie like this, I only believed that him and Morbius were friends.The villain was predictable and the movie has plot holes leading to scenes that don't make sense, even the ending was a little confusing.The action scenes moved too fast and were hard to see, especially with all the CGI they have for the looks of the vampires. Only rarely you will get a clear shot, but it's mostly shaky cam.The mid-credit scenes are confusing when it comes to the Spider-Man universe, and it made me wonder why they are doing all of this to something already setup and without any motivation in why it is happening.I would re-watch this to see if I can understand it more in what it is trying to do in connecting with other Marvel universes.But I found this movie mostly mediocre. Some people might like it and some fans might be dissatisfied with what they got.",

Matt Smith was the saving grace in all scenes he was in, and the relationship portrayed between Morbius and him was lovely. And that's it. That's one of the few things that was entertaining to watch.I really wanted to like this. But we've seen so many origin stories at this point, the script and dialogue has to be Somewhat good.

This doesn't happen often, but when it does it's nice to see.Can't say much else. Jared isn't entirely to blame as the script has him starting off on an offshore freighter for some reason and just gets more bizarre from there. 10 star fanboys, industry employees and bot farms will continue to prop up the dismal ratings and reviews.",

Not too impressed by Matt Smith's performance to be honest. Very enjoyable. I'm beginning to think that alot of critics are paid by Disney to give their own produced shows and movies great reviews. Even when they're terrible. But, those same critics give shows and films bad reviews that don't deserve it. Like halo and morbius. I for one am glad I went to the cinema to see it. Unlike endgame. 3hrs I'll never get back. In short. Don't go by dodgy critic reviews. If you like the trailer and the synopsis sounds interesting. Watch it. Make your own mind up. Don't be a sheep.

People in the Internet read the first reviews of critics and started spreading what they were saying, so suddenly everyone was saying how bad this film was without having even watched it. Now they have watched it and nothing's gonna change their minds. It's a snowball of hate that grows and grows and it's completely uncalled for.Jared Leto is getting the same amount of hate he got when he portrayed The Joker; sure, it was a very \"out there\" portrayal, but still unique and original. I believe the same thing happened back then. Which I don't understand, because the guy is a tremendous actor (and a great freaking singer too, but that's besides the point). Maybe people have something against him? Maybe he did something bad that I don't know about and got \"canceled\"? In any case, the fact stands: he's a really good actor.Watch Morbius without reading too many reviews and make up YOUR mind. That's the only way to actually see this movie for what it is - a dark adventure that does its best to serve as a connection between universes, but also a great origin story for one of the most underrated Spider-Man villains ever.",

    "text": "Morbius is a masterclsss in how to bore an audience.The action is the simplest mistake that this movie makes, there isn't much of it and it's not very good. It's mostly just super fast flying around clashing around things and you can't tell what's happening and then it randomly goes into slow motion to show you what's happening for about a second.The story is a very generic anti-hero story, he does experiments, he turns himself into a superhuman of some kind and does evil things, and then becomes the hero in the end. It is the most basic stuff in between that simple structure and it's very blandThe characters are very uninteresting, the cop characters show up sometimes, say some unfunny lines, and pretty much do nothing. The love interest is only there for a little bit and then she pretty much does nothing until they all of a sudden love each other. Michael Morbius is not that interesting, he just does things because the story wants him to and there is little explanation for his actions.The villain deserves his own category because he is terrible. The first issue is he's just morbius but evil so the fights between him and morbius are pretty boring. His motivations are so stupid, he pretty much goes from the normal friend to a murderer because... he wants Morbius to think his powers aren't a curse??? And people don't know what it's like to be him so he just kills them??? And then at the end we're supposed to feel somewhat bad for him like he made a mistake, no he literally gets powers and the first thing he does is murder a bunch of people for \"fun\" like it's so stupid.There are some positives thoughJared Leto is actually good in the role and he does a great job with how little he is givenThe first action scene I actually liked, the first person shots were cool and the horror elements were different from your normal superhero movie and I liked it.I liked some of the music in the movie, it was adjacent to a horror movie soundtrack but mixed with a superhero soundtrack.A lot of the movie may be bland but it's not absolutely horrendous so it's not like it's the worst movie in the worldBUT the stupidest thing is the end credit scenes SPOILERS HERE (although I wouldn't bother caring for spoilers)Michael Keaton's vulture is somehow teleported to the Sony universe, which literally makes no sense. In No Way Home, all of the people that knew Peter Parker were being transported to the MCU, and by making everyone forget Peter Parker all of the people being transported were sent back to their original universe. So here's the problem, Michael Keaton's vulture is originally from the MCU so he would not just be teleported to the Sony universe. Also when he gets transported there he just assumes spiderman had something to do with it, so he somehow gets his suit and meets up with morbius to kill spiderman I guess. What ever happened to him caring about his family??? The first thing he thinks when teleported to a new universe is to kill spiderman because he might have had something to do with it, not the fact that his family is just gone. Sony is just trying so hard to make a sinister six movie, but it's just not gonna happen if they keep half-assing the movies that are supposed to make you care about a team of people.",

    "text": "Morbius: A Vampire with a scientific origin story. It fits into the MCU, there are a few clues buried in the film so pay attention, no need to wait for mid-credits teasers. A tale of mortality, Morbius and his \"brother\" Milo have a chronic blood illness, they meet as 10 year olds in a clinic run by Nicholas. Morbius vows to ensure that they grow into cranky old men together. Morbius is cranky anyway, 25 years later he turns down a Nobel Prize at the Stockholm ceremony because his invention of artificial blood was only a by product of his ongoing search for a cure for the blood disease. Milo's wealth funds the research laboratory run by Morbius but they both realise time is short as does Martine his co-researcher. An experiment splicing vampire bat genes with his own goes awry transforming Morbius into a Vampire and putting Martine at risk.Some great combat scenes, especially aboard the freighter where the clandestine experiment is being carried out, Morbius picks off his victims among the gangways and pipes. The tearing out of throats etc is a bit restrained and often off camera to ensure a lower age rating for the film. The opening sequence involving Morbius encountering a cave full of vampire bats is spectacular. While generally impressive the CGI is a bit ropy but not in the usual sense: Vampires move swiftly leaving coloured ropes or tendrils in their wake. The vampire nemesis of Morbius is truly savage, like the Joker at times with his grimaces. Jared Leto is best when he plays Morbius in his debilitated state or as a Vampire, less so when Morbius is an enhanced human. Jared Harris is Nicholas with Matt Smith as Milo and Adria Arjona playing Martine; all put in convincing performances. I get the impression that some crucial scenes may have ended up on the editing room floor during so I await a director's cut. Directed by Daniel Espinosa from a screenplay by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless. 7/10.",

For the storyline, casting, and dialogue, this is again, a solid entry. It has intelligence (we agree to suspend disbelief, and no more than usual here) and the necessary dollops of humor and romance that we also expect, for example, of a Bond film. Where the film excels is in the soundtrack by composer/sound designer. Jon Petter Ekstrand. An absolutely brilliant mixture of orchestral/symphonic, techno/electronic, and Luigi Russolo-esque noise composition (nods to John Cage, too). Highlights include the microtonal horn theme for the \"evil side\" of the vampire bat-man; the brilliant sonic representation of echolocation (this MUST be experienced in IMAX and/or Dolby Cinema Theatre of AMC); and Milo's \"mad-I'm-a-vampire-killing-machine\" celebratory dance to the chanted rap-like techno song \"Ekse\" by Stockholm based Off The Meds. And the length, at 100 minutes, is perfect! Ignore the naysayers! Catch this one in the theaters, preferably IMAX!",

However it turned out to be as satisfactory as any other action movies. Almost every actor's performance was okay, I liked it actually. However, the screenplay could have been deeper. The process for the characters to evolve is not enough and it actually needed more time and deeper meaning to it. The visual and special effects were satisfactorily interesting, however they could explore the abilities of the main character further and deeper.Generally the movie is satisfactorily entertaining, if you lower your expectations level and enjoy the movie.",

One of those in my party said they liked it better than Eternals, and I think it's markedly better than the Edward Norton Hulk, the first Thor film, the first Suicide Squad, the theatrical Justice League, and X-Men Age of Apocalypse / Dark Phoenix as well.Even marginally better than both Venom films in my opinion.That's not to say it's great, but it had enough fun moments and redeeming qualities to make it worth a watch.Apart from the first action scene which was solid, most of the rest were not particularly thrilling.Jared Leto was solid enough and Matt Smith was great.Plot was a bit thin, dialogue was proficient, and pacing was good.Special effects were good, general tone and atmosphere was well done, and the styling of Morbius' monstrous side was perfect.If the trailer held any appeal whatsoever and you go in with very measured expectations there's more to enjoy here than the current ratings would suggest.",

    "text": "Morbius is a jaw-clenching film, filled with jump scares, betrayal and a bit of romance. The film is also great to watch if you are a fan of bats.Morbius digs deep into the life of Dr. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto), a man who has a deeply dangerous condition but is a complete genius in the lab and in the operating room. Morbius and his best friend Loxias Crown (Matt Smith), who he calls Milo, have been struggling with this condition since they were born, and they have not been able to find a cure yet. Morbius at a young age is accepted into a gifted school for kids, and he leaves Milo to find a cure for both of them. As Morbius gets older, he does more experiments, and he ends up unleashing this beast he may not be able to defeat.As the storyline suggests, one theme of the film is that sometimes you don't feel like yourself. There are external forces that can cause you to do things that you would never do or say things you would never say. We all can be triggered by situations, circumstances, people and events that take us out of character; but hopefully, not to this extreme. The CGI in this film is phenomenal; you see a lot of detail in both the characters and the settings. The settings are very cool, and it is fun to see all the different landscapes. The music matches each scene very well, especially in the intense scenes. Not a lot of films have the amount of suspense and thrills that Morbius has, and it is unlike other Marvel films.The message of Morbius is don't lose sight of who you are no matter what happens. There is some language that would be inappropriate for younger viewers.I give Morbius 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 18, plus adults. Morbius is available now in theaters.By SaniyaRain F., KIDS FIRST!",

It's very visually stylish during the action scenes, but there's so many effects it obscures the action and the still/slow motion scenes add little to it. The characters are weak, the plot is clich\u00e9 and has holes, the editing is choppy, there's an unfunny cop duo who I presume were supposed to be some sort of comic relief, and an anticlimactic ending.

It lacks transition in story arcs and even managed to score poorly in effects, as well subpar dialog. The 2nd half of the movie in particular was abysmal with cliched uninvolving action scenes. The actors seem up to the task but the direction and script fail. There seems to be a love affair with Spiderman-type jumping and flying cinematography that get badly worn out and overused. The movie concept in Morbius has more potential but the execution is flubbed. In the hands of better filmmakers and a better story - it might've been good. Probably not even worth a watch. 4/10.",

From the start you get a real connection to each character and you are hooked emotionally instantly. To summarise , i feel that this film has raised the bar for what i expect in superhero movies and after watching felt changed as a person.",

After seeing it in theaters I do believe this film is getting a lot of manufactured hate to sway viewers not to see it. It really isn't that bad. It does of course have flaws. It's low budget was obvious in it's many scenes of cgi, acting was cringe at times, some horrible humor and lines, and some of the cinematography was a little bizarre to me. Also, it suffered from a short runtime that made it so that characters weren't fleshed out as much as they could've been. But with all it's flaws, it was still a fun and entertaining film. The cgi may have been odd a lot of the time, but still looked like a really cool video game. Some of the effects (especially when flying or fighting) were pretty cool. The actors felt like they were dedicated to their parts, even with some weird lines. The dynamic between Leto and Smith was fantastic as well. This origin story was a tad generic, but I feel like MCU fans should be okay with that by now. Overall it definitely had flaws, but is nowhere near as bad as critics and certain MCU fans are trying to make it out to be. Give it a watch and judge for yourself.",

From beginning to end the film is constantly riddled with reshoots and obvious studio meddling that denies the film the ability to tell its own unique story. The story that is somewhat told feels rushed an unfinished, never fully taking the time to develop its characters, their motivations, or even the superpowers the film centers upon. It caused many inconsistencies within the plot, focusing on trying to get the point across without doing the work to achieve its goals. Every scene of the film looks chopped up and filmed oddly with camera movements that never rest for one moment to meditate on the actions taking place. The performances are non existent due to the amount of distracting visuals and pretentious story elements that are thrown at the viewers face. The film lacks any flavor or distinct personality, that makes the film feel generic, passionless, and ultimately forgettable. Along with ruining elements of unrelated, better films, this abomination of studio integrity is an experience that should not be given the attention the studio desperately needs.",

    "text": "Morbius, Sony's latest offering in their universe of Spider-related content, finally hits theaters after a number of delays, which one would think would be used to help fine tune the film. Penned by duo Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, known for box office grenades like Dracula Untold, The Last Witch Hunter, and Gods of Egypt, Morbius proves yet again that Sony either has zero grasp on storytelling or saw just how well received the schlocky Venom was and has decided to fully lean into nonsense. At the center of the film is the incredibly popular and largely beloved Spider-Man villain Michael Morbius, gifted scientist hell bent on finding a cure for his blood illness. This recklessness leads to increasingly dangerous experiments, the latest of which splices the genes of humans with vampire bats. The disastrous result (it's comics, after all, it wouldn't be comics if science didn't go hilariously wrong) transforms Morbius into a living vampire, giving him abilities beyond his wildest dreams.Morbius isn't good. It's outright bad. The plotting, the acting, the directing, the visual effects, and the bland score all fail on almost every conceivable level. Outside of Spiderverse, Sony's inability to grasp the concepts behind the characters that inhabit Spider-Man's world is embarrassingly baffling to witness. A decent first act, followed by a sluggish second act to a rushed third act and abrupt ending make watching the movie a jerky ride, to say the least. The end credit scenes, which were scenes from the actual movie (badly) recontextualized to hint at something bigger, don't work within the universe they've set up, within the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe, or even within its own story. Character decisions just as confusing as the directing decisions lead to a movie that Sony seemed content with slapping its name on and letting it ride under the guise of being Spider and MCU-adjacent.Starring Academy Award winning actor Jared Leto, Morbius is one of the most uninteresting, apathetic, languid performances of his career. When compared to the gusto he put into Paolo Gucci in The House of Gucci, here Leto seems drained of all spirit or interest. To be his first major tentpole movie that he leads himself, the decision to underplay Morbius as a character who gets from A to B simply because the plot demands so is baffling. All of the drowsiness of Leto's performance is overcorrected by Matt Smith. Smith, ready to dial it up to 150 in each scene, steals the attention every time he's on the screen, and not always the best ways. After the second act turn, the somewhat subdued performance cranks into high gear as Smith is unleashed to run circles around a sleepy Leto. Standing in between them attempting to keep the peace is Jared Harris, who, after a 25 year gap from the beginning scenes seems to have not aged a day himself (almost like a vaaaaaaaampiiiiire). Harris does his best with the paltry material he's given as the wisest head in the room that serves to galvanize Leto later in the film.Also starring Adira Arjona as Marine Bancroft, poor Arjona is saddled with the baggage of Leto's lackadasical performance. Try as she might, there's not much she can contend with, leading to an awful and forced chemistry between the two. Placed sporadiacally throughout the film, whether due to suspect editing or shabby writing, Arjona's Bancroft deserves to be in a much better movie than this. A smart and capable scientist in her own right, one wonders why she joins Morbius in his less than above board plans. It's possible 'love makes a person do funny things' but with the chemistry we see between these two, I find it highly unlikely. Tyrese, winding down his time on the Fast & Furious franchise and ready to hop into another, plays it straight down the middle as FBI Agent Stroud. Stroud's no-nonsense approach makes him distinguishable enough to ensure that he'll return for the inevitable sequel. The only person who seems to be having a ball is comedian Al Madrigal as Stroud's partner Rodriguez. Madrigal comedic delivery and quippy nature bring a fresh air to the otherwise bleakness happening around him.Directed by Daniel Espinosa, Morbius has put on full display all of the flaws of his craft and technique. Scenes that could have had an inkling of potential, such as any confrontation between Morbius and Milo in the third act, are devoid of any passion between the actors or stakes set for the audience. The pacing, which is applaudable for hitting all the familiar beats and plot points of an origin story, takes a nose dive in the third act as the film's abrupt ending left me confused and baffled as to the decisions made to end the film how it does. Tonally speaking, it seems as if there's time FBI agents Straud and Rodriguez are in a completely different movie than everybody else, and the removal of those two characters seems to do little to change the story presented. Possibly the most frustrating aspect of the endeavor is the amount of subpar visual effects in the film. For a movie that's been pushed back a countless number of times, one would think that would afford the vfx supervisors time to tinker, tighten up, or smooth out any issues, yet thanks largely in part to the CGI, Morbius feels like a movie that was removed from 2003 and reinserted into our current timeline.But, credit must be given where it's due. The end of the first act action scene on board the tanker Morbius is conducting his experiments is an entertaining watch; a turn from standard comic book fare to a more darker, creepier horror vibe. The freshly turned Morbius ripping through the security guards on the boat makes for a fun watch as Espinosa finds different ways to tease Morbius without fully revealing him as he lurks in the shadows and stalks his prey from multiple angles. A true standout amongst the rest of the haphazardly composed scenes, the tanker sequence is by far the standout piece of the movie, lead by some genuinely good directing and editing.Overall, when it comes to Morbius, there's little to compliment or turn a hopeful eye to. An incredibly weak story, further hampered by bad writing, hammy acting, shoddy CGI, and milquetoast directing makes the film a rather dull affair. While not the worst superhero movie we've gotten since in the early 2000s boom, it's certainly the worst of Sony's handling of the material and there's little to boast of or prop up in a positive light. Anchored by a lethargic performance from lead Jared Leto, the film lacks any substance that makes its 104-minute runtime worth a trip to go see.",

Well, my BP stayed at 90/60. It would have been even lower if I hadn't drank 2 liters of cola in my boredom.

However, as much as I really wanted to enjoy it, after 15 minutes, I could have told that would happen in the next 90 minutes, even with close to 0 knowledge of Marvel characters.The shirtless scene was nice - lol - I gave an extra star for that. :))The actors did their bests I guess, the CGI, and the makeups were fine for me, and there were a few great sound effects and cam angle shots as well, but the music lacked of creativity, and I really missed the action, the BLOOD, and exciting wow scenes which would have made me want to watch it again. It won't happen, unfortunately.",

The delays resulted in complaints from crew, etc.Sure he was not crippled but what if a performer was?? Would the delays in bathroom trips be a cause for complaints?? Sure as heck not!Also, as is the trend today, unfounded rumors about his wild life when on the road with his band 30 Second to Mars, made its way into reviews of the film as if they actually were relevant to it. As for them, well, I was a road musician for years and show me one who has not had a smidgen of the wild life?This movies is a entertaining film with an entertaining story and that is all that ought to matter (oh yeah and great special effects).

Walk into a theatre, leave preconceptions at the door, enjoy a movie from start to finish for what it is - A little predictable once it gets going however that doesn't take away from the might of the Morbius experience and especially what it sets up post credit...

This movie is far from as bad as they say, but I also would not describe it as anything spectacular. I feel that people are comparing it to other Marvel properties such as No Way Home and that is why reviews are so bad. That is unfair to compare it to such other films as Morbius is a fresh take on Marvel it feels. It is obvious that the delays ended up holding back what this movie could have been, perhaps what it truly should have been. It was enjoyable to watch from start to end. Loved the action sequences and CGI was beautiful. Takes a little bit to get through the more monotonous beginnings, but once you get to sink your teeth into the good parts, oh boy does it deliver. Some characters needed more development and the story what is a bit disjointed. Jared Leto is finally in a role that suits him, Morbius and Leto will only get better with more appearances. I rated it a 7/10 because a 7/10 to me means that it was an enjoyable movie regardless of whatever may be wrong with it, and I would gladly watch again. It is clear it would have been better suited as a rated R film, but with its current restrictions down to PG-13 I would say it is worth a watch at least. Don't expect to be blown away, except maybe by some of the action and CGI. I can see ratings from 5/10 to 7/10 being a fair range as everyones taste are different, but some of these other reviews I see are just taking it too far because it is not what Marvel is used to pushing.",

It's baseline superhero shlock, but even its expected plot points are underwhelming because Morbius is disinterested in itself. The characters are boring, the romance is empty, the growth is stagnant, and the final fight is disappointing. Plus, Jared Leto is a complete flatline, providing no charisma or vulnerability to relate to. In every way, Morbius is void of emotional investment, leaving its blatant commercialism to stick out like a sore thumb. Simply put, Morbius is soulless.Technically, Morbius is less incompetent but still shallow. The sound is adequate and the effects are convincing (although CGI is severely overused), but those are the only positives. The music is a cheap imitation and occasionally awkward. The production design is painfully generic, with a noticeable lack of blood. The inconsistent editing warps the pacing and jumbles action sequences. Also, the imagery is bland, dark, and cluttered, which is unpleasant and confusing. Lastly, Morbius doesn't have direction. There isn't a tone, message, or passion driving this film.

This film is bad, and for sure a pass.Do not see it no matter what.",

    "text": "Jesus this movie was a chore. Ultimate boredom from beginning to end. There's nothing more to say. It's just a bland generic run of the mill superhero movie. Tries nothing remotely unique with a script and dialogue with such less substance you would rather watch keeping up with the kardashians. The end credit scenes just shows how lazy Sony is. Leaching off the success of the MCU to draw in viewers. I noticed it with venom 1 which was garbage. I wasted my money watching that. I was not about to do it with the sequel so I pirated let there be carnage online and it was definitely an improvement over venom 1... but still a very over the mill superhero movie.... Then this one... just worse if not just as bad as venom 1.... Uninteresting in every angle.PROS:it finished...Jared Leto was okay as the lead role I guess.Effects were cool to look at,I appreciate the idea of a dark superhero movie taking a dark execution I'm fine with. I just want a good movie. Look at Joker. A movie about a villain and it's dark as heck... this one I appreciate it even though it doesn't execute it well.CONS:script boring,dialogue extremely bland on delivery,plot,EVERYONE LOOKS SO TIRED... and uninteresting performances in every way, the characters look so uninterested in the plot and story. When they do it's a bit cringe. Only actors I liked were Leto and the female. Other than that everyone was just there with a terrible performanceaction was repeated in sequences that we saw way too many times already in one movie. Usually you need a variety of the action to make it interesting. Sonic 2 did a better job at making the action watchable than this garbage.Villain was so bland and predictable, which was one of my biggest problems of venom 1... venom 2 worked on the villain better. But I think Morbius has just as much a bad villain as venom 1 was.Pretty much everything to make a movie worth to watch is thrown out of the windowPredictability: now usually a movie being predictable can be fine... nothing wrong with it as long as it delivers on a good foundation script, or something of substance, a clear direction... this film however doesn't even have that. And when you have a story and plot that is just predictable with twists that are just so awfully executed you know it's a bad movieEnd credit scenes were so desperate. Sony universe needs to end already this is terrible..This movie I will rank aTIRED VAMPIRE DUMPSTER-FIRE / 10P. S ( I like the idea of dark comic book movies, that's not the problem, I liked Joker, V for Vendetta, Watchmen, The Road To Perdition, some aspects of BVS, and SO many more I can name... this movie just felt more bland and generic compared to those)",

Packed with over-the-top-action and in consequence boring somehow. A movie which is exchangeable to many other movies by its qualities. In the last 20 minutes it looked like they wouldn't know how to end it and stuff it with action to make an excuse of it. After that the last cheesy parts were unbearable. No! I don't like that. I'm a Marvel fan and was in a rush in the MCU by phase 1-4, which had a pretty awesome peak in 'Avengers: Endgame'. I also like the Marvel TV-series, at least most of them. But this movie is dull.",

He did so well dodging the bullets. Also the scene in the movie where the one fortnite skin comes in was cool. He was a detective and was good and his job because he found Morbius. I will buy the skin the next time it comes to the item shop. I hope Morbius is in the battle pass next season for fortnite.",

Delayed multiple times due to Covid, this superhero film should have opted for a direct to streaming path instead. It would have got many more viewers that way.Morbius is the story of Michael Morbius, who suffers from a rare blood disease. To find a cure, he captures vampire bats and tries to splice their genes with his. He is successful but the experiment also changes him into a bloodthirsty vampire. Rest of the plot: anyone can put that together with the help of one small detail - Michael has a friend with the same blood disease.Morbius is an interesting character but neither Jared Leto nor the makers have made a genuine attempt at making something substantial here. Even at 105 minutes, the film takes a toll on you just as Morbius would have if he sucked your blood. Even @venommovie with its pathetic plot is better because it had a very interesting lead pair in Venom & Brock. The film co-stars Matt Smith as Michael's friend turned foe, Adria Arjona, Jared Harris, Al Madrigal, Tyrese Gibson and Michael Keaton, who reprises his role as Adrian Toomes.There isn't a single thing that is redeemable from this superhero film. The plot is non-existent, the characters are half-baked, the CGI is pathetic and the mid-credit scene doesn't make any sense because it just won't work!!!!Sony's Marvel, it is time to come home...",

Fairly speaking this should worth a 6+, which the rating again wrongly reflect on like most of the movies, as a lot the raters and critics are just a bunch of pretentious kids without much sense.",

When he takes the cure and it has side effects that are horrible, he decides his friend would be better off the way his friend is for now. I would even say it is kind of sad.",

    "text": "Please bear in mind, this is my opinion which is subjective.I fail to see where the critics can go so hard on this film if I am to be honest.Let me begin by saying Leto does a good job with what he has been given, it's not a master piece but there aren't many of them around now days and given we live in a time where people love to hate on Sony or Leto - this film didn't stand a chance.It's a good film, a good story & overall I love the character Morbius. Sony are trying their hardest to create something of their own which will always prove to be difficult when they're essentially in their own world away from Disney.I do think if you pitted Leto's Morbius against Tom Hollands Spiderman then we would have a great film on our hands. For us to get such a blockbuster it would mean Sony admitting defeat & essentially signing all of these characters over which is never going to happen.... So a Disney PlayStation 6 is more likely if I'm honest...This film is good, it has good moments, the on screen effects are next to non, they display his powers in a cohesive way which keeps it interesting I just fail to see how RT have given this a 17% score when it honestly deserves a 70% at minimum but as I said, most fans who don't understand the contractual constraints Morbius has against it (Sony/Disney malarkey) a lot of fans will be wondering why they don't tie this in and why they don't mention Spideys latest fight instead they're in their own pocket universe with their hands tied behind their back.A good film, well worth the watch & I would watch again - Yes.7.7/10 rounded up is 8/10.",

Mobius is in a lot of ways the Atypical Anti-Hero movie, but it also adds more to the character complexity of Michael Mobius, in the comics he was a gradstudent competing alongside Peter parker and injected himself with a sample of his blood, I enjoyed the fact that the method used for his Chara Ter development was introduced in a more unique fashion. Ignore the low scores and just enjoy the movie. It is rather good, co sideri g I didn't have any high hopes for it.

The cgi for his powers is way better than alot of characters in the mcu & i definitely enjoyed the combat / fighting aspect of it rather than just lame magic like wanda or captain marvel .with the 2nd movie they'll hopefully redeem his reputation but me and my friend had fun watching this and id def rewatch it again.",

    "text": "Morbius, the third entry in Sony's own Spider-man Universe, is a comic book movie out of the 90s Sam Raimi Spider-man era, like Daredevil or Ghost Rider.Sony's unsophisticated approach leaves Morbius out of sync with modern blockbuster expectations. It adapts the bare minimum from its source material and instead the script draws a lot from horror films we've seen before.Jared Leto, in his first leading man role in a blockbuster, shelves his headline-making method acting and plays it straight to a script that gives him nothing interesting to do, rendering a bland and humorless experience.To say a few good things, the Morbius CGI make-up is well done as it allows the vampire look to change in various states of thirst. It visually shows Morbius' struggle controlling his thirst.Michael Morbius and Milo's story begins in a promising manner. The character dynamic is borrowed from Park Chan-wook's Thirst, where a reluctant vampire creates a bloodthirsty vampire. However, Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless' script never follows this friendship in earnest. The middle portion remixes ideas and scenes from other movies in a box-ticking manner, such as David Cronenberg's The Fly and Blade.The script sinfully ends abruptly after its climax and is missing a satisfying resolution. Yes, Morbius defeated the villain but how does he truly come to terms with becoming a vampire? The movie provides no answer.Finally, in the film's most cynical move, it immediately teases what's next with its two after-credit scenes. The first scene was expected but poorly written. The second scene made no sense at all and was like a studio exec puppeting the actors to say whatever he wants like Rick Moranis playing with action figures in Spaceballs.If Sony chose to bring Tom Holland's Spider-man back into this Sony universe, I'd be scratching my head on how he would fit in with this roster of villains in tone. By giving each villain a solo outing, they've all become anti-heroes.Sony's Venom movies, which are oddball buddy comedies, fared much better and can be enjoyed in a guilty pleasure trashy way purely from the silliness of watching Tom Hardy argue with himself. Ultimately, what sinks Morbius into being a dud is it's a lot of \"been there, done that\" and doesn't put anything interesting on the table.",

It was pretty forgettable over all, especially the action sequences, which isn't a good sign for an action movie, and throughout things just happened with no to very little build up and the few characters we had got very little in terms of development or explaining their relationships, and then it just kinda ended without me being ready for it.That said I was never really bored in the theatre. It was an interesting enough premise, I understood the motivations and it kept a pretty straight line throughout. None of these actors are gonna win any Oscars for their work on this movie, but unlike some others I had no problem with any performance. Over all an OK night at the theatre and I would rather re-watch this than anything Disney/Marvel had put out post Far from home, except No Way Home, and even that isn't super good IMO, it's just special to watch because of all the returning actors. Try to pitch that movie but have every returning character from the other universes be played by different people you'd end up with something properly stupid.",

You might like it. Or even better, love it.",

Please, I beg you, don't make the same mistake I did and waste your precious money and time watching this moribund specimen, on the big screen or otherwise. I swear if I had been watching it at home on freeview, I'd have turned over to another channel to watch something else. I haven't been so disappointed by a film of this kind since I saw The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen; yes, it's almost that bad.There really are no redeeming features to this. The plot is paper thin, character development perfunctory, the effects are not special (just a bit irritating), and it's not even cool. I counted two lines of dialogue which raised a hint of a smile, and it's so predictable. That I can forgive if I'm entertained, but Morbius failed by every measure. The casting wasn't terrible - I've enjoyed work by all the main actors before - but they really had nothing to get their teeth into. The kindest thing I can say is that it was less than 2 hours long, giving me time to write this review when I got home. If someone did away with the director and the script writer, I dare say no one would miss them.",

    "text": "First off I love my comics. But I never got into Morbius stuff. Felt to clich\u00e9 for a character. I skipped the movie at the theaters because people said it was bad. As always it was comic lovers of him saying it was bad because it wasn't like the comics. Which shouldn't matter in a movie.So I finally seen the movie and I have to say, it was not as bad as I thought it would be. Leto did a great job in his role. However the movie didn't really give me any emotions while watching. Even after the end I was like \"Hmm\" and that was it.It felt out of for a Marvel movie. The story wasn't all that appealing. As with the same reason I didn't care about the comic, vampire stuff is just always the same. The pacing also felt really off too. The only things that I even cared about were the credit scenes. If Morbius never appeared again I probably wouldn't even remember he existed in a movie.While vampires are kind of repetitive, I still am looking forward to Blade. Who is WAY more interesting then Morbious seems to be. I am curious how the two may fit together in the MCU given they both have the same vampire theme going.Again, Leto's acting was great. But the movie just felt lifeless to me. Instead of paying to rent it, maybe just borrow it from your local library instead. I have no interest in watching it again nor do I want to see any bonus features usually on a disc.",

    "text": "Some people love to see a Marvel film fail, some dislike Jared Leto and some are offended by something in the film. However, the film is certainly not something to hate or is in any other way special. It is a formula film with cardboard characters that no amount of acting could have saved. And they used the wrong formula, too. It is totally forgettable, in a way that makes me work to remember what it was about, minutes after seeing it.But it's easy to see how this came about. It's an Avi Arad production, who has been working in the Marvel universe for his entire producer career and had some successes, but the large majority of his work is of the same kind: targeting the widest tier of the audience, uselessly over the top, badly written, low budget (or better said: wasted budget) and underusing their cast. The end credits (not the scenes, the actual credits) say it all: a total of 6 actors that have any relevance to the story, then minutes and minutes of scrolling for \"the team\" which includes every single union person that threw a glance towards the studio lot. This film isn't for you, it's by the masses, for the masses. The movie itself is little more (or less, qualitatively) than a play with a lot of CGI thrown in.I actually feel bad for Leto. In this film he was subdued, reasonable, playing \"the doctor\" perfectly and abstaining from the wild shenanigans he is infamous for. The other Jared, Mr. Harris, who I admire as an actor had a few scenes as a very secondary character. Do you see Michael Keaton in the cast? That's because he appears in post ending scenes, to hint at a future story combining The Vulture and Morbius. And Matt Smith... in the Dr. Who series playing a different kind of Doctor, much maligned because he was coming to replace the marvelous David Tennant. He was actually a fantastic Dr. Who, compared to most, and here he is reduced to a mindless beast with a complete lack of self control.Where is the story? There is none. From the nonsensical start scene to the ending that screams \"Sorry! Next one is going to have Keaton in it! It will be good!\", the plot is as linear and predictable as they can be. I mean, comic stories are usually trash, but this one isn't even special enough to warrant ridicule. It's just bland and featureless and pointless.Bottom line: from the producer of Blade, with the budget of Disney Marvel and with a cast that could have achieved almost anything, comes a movie about a day walking vampire that has no story, no acting, no soundtrack, no blood, no sense and provides no reason to ever watch it.",

At the end it felt like a cliff hanger where none of the characters are fully developed, especially the detectives, Martine and Nicholas, even Mobius himself. Milo has the best arc. Overall character backstory are like 40% covered and doesn't explain much. That's not a movie by any standard. More like a tv show.",

However for a standalone movie it wasn't bad, but because people dont know Morbius I think it would of helped if they had cameos of others like blade etc. Or they should of had him introduced into someone else's movie first like how Black Panther was introduced in the avengers movies. I think you should see it for yourself everybody has their own taste. I like the darker side of Marvel like Blade, Spawn, Ghost Rider, Punisher etc.",

    "text": "After countless delays and pushed back premiere dates, Morbius has finally hit the big screen, sadly without much interest or fanfare. Even worse, without many favorable reviews from critics. I was having second thoughts about going, but I had purchased my ticket a few weeks back. After all, for me an opportunity to take in a new Marvel film in the theater isn't something to bypass lightly. Not really knowing what I was in for, I grabbed my movie bag and venture to my favorite theater to see what's what.Other than the few trailers I'd seen beforehand, I went into Morbius cold, never having read any of the comics and being completely unfamiliar with the character. I can't say anything about how the film holds up to \"canon\" as a result. I can say that Morbius the film is a straight up origins film and for my time and money a fairly solid one at that. I've definitely seen much worse.While there's no deep dive into the character of Michael Morbius but we're given enough info (though some of it's vague) as to who he is, his motivations, and the type of person he is to make the film work. Morbius is heavily CGI, most of it well executed and effective, there is some overuse as well that becomes campy, but again nothing that's a detriment to the overall film viewing experience. The same holds true with the prosthetics as well, particularly in the case of Matt Smith's Milo (there a couple of scenes that made me laugh-out-loud when I shouldn't have).Morbius is stunningly atmospheric and has plenty of good action, nice touches of humor, and humanity. A strong cast does there best and gives it there all to their credit. Due to the runtime of an hour fort-four minutes the character development is limited but leaves enough of an impression to want to see where they go next. The ending is also anticlimactic as a result as well. Quite abrupt to say the least.Predictability/formulaic is also present, yet the film remains interesting and entertaining nonetheless. It's also clear that given the subject/plot that an R-Rated film would've been a better choice for this one than going the PG-13 route. Tempering the blood and violence to get the more kid friendly rating definitely impacted the handling of the film and toning it down didn't do anyone any favors.From my viewpoint, Morbius isn't the greatest but it most certainly isn't the worse either. I was intrigued, never bored, an entertained the entire film. Yes, there are questions I have and holes that I want filled but I'm glad I went and saw it on the big screen. I most certainly want to see what's next for the characters/franchise as well. Do you NEED to see this one at the theater? No, waiting for a home viewing will probably work just as well. But, if you WANT to see it on the big screen, I say go for it. It's a fun little popcorn flick that doesn't deserve the haterade being thrown at it in my opinion.Morbius gets a 7 from me.Oh, don't bolt right away, you get a couple of credit scenes.",

    "text": "Morbius is simply the greatest film I ever had the pleasure of watching. Everything in the film is so masterfully crafted, so artistically and emotionally powerful, that I truly struggle to bring words to my feelings about the film. We, as a society, know of many classic films, CITIZEN KANE, BEN-HUR, DOCTOR ZHIVAGO, STAR WARS, THE GODFATHER, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, APOCALYPSE NOW, ANNIE HALL, GOODFELLAS, JAWS, and many more, but Morbius simply outdoes all of those films in every way imaginable. It is simply incredible and breathtaking. The heart-wrenching performances, particularly that of Jared Leto, whose tragic descent from good-willed doctor to Morbius is painful, saddening, and epic to watch. We simply see a man's descent into madness, traveling into the heart of darkness inside us all, and never returning. And that is the core theme of the film. A human story, one which plagues us all. Throughout the film, which should more rightly be described as an adventure, an event, we not only follow and care for cinema's greatest character, but we become him. It would also be a crime against humanity to not mention the secondary character, Sir Matt Smith, whose visual variety and comic dancing masterfully balances a deeply complex film with universal comedy. And the visuals are simply striking. If you do not speak English, Watch Morbius. It is not the dialogue that makes the film so universally human. It is the pure visual storytelling that makes this film so damn beautiful to watch. The many layers of themes, ideas and complexities make Morbius like an onion. Peel it back, and you'll find something new. Not to mention the intricate choice of color representation, as well as the soundtrack. My God. How beautiful. Once the music hits your ears, you, without control, start sobbing at the pure beauty of it. It travels through your ears, yes, but it shakes your whole body, your emotions, your subconscious, and it invites you to join this epic journey. It is warm, comforting, and conveying with so-beautiful-it-hurts emotion that it is here to love you, protect you, please you, YOU. You deserve it. You give yourself to the music and film completely, and your pleasure and joy is insurmountable. Not to mention the realistic dialogue that bounces off the relationships of the characters like tennis balls off a wall. You feel yourself in the room, talking to Michael Morbius, experiencing his pain, joy, and human journey. I can describe the film as long as possible, but it simply could not do it Justice in its purest form. But there is one issue I must address following the film: the harsh, barbaric, and uneducated response from professional \"critics\", as they fancy to call themselves. It simply is uncalled for. No more could one colossally misunderstand a piece of art. We may look at olds and new films from 80 to 1 years ago and critically re-assess them, but Morbius needs no such pampering. Let idiots be idiots. The true intellectual, film-loving thinkers will continue to commune together and discuss this complex, striking and unexpected film while the other fat, blubbery armchair critics complain and make fools of themselves. When the film Morbius is inducted into the National Film Library for being history, aesthetically, and culturally significant and preserved for the rest of culture and time, not only will scholars many decades from now look at these idiotic manbabies as what they are: fools, but they will also study Morbius more so than ever before. I strongly see a new society being built upon the film Morbius (as it would, should, and will be the only surviving piece of culture or art from the first run of humanity), a better society, a complex society. With all of this said, Morbius IS cinema's greatest accomplishment, and I highly doubt that ever changing. Unless, of course, Morbius II: Morbin' Time is made, then a true culture war will be fought between the two films. I, however, will say this: Morbius II will both surpass and respect the original film, build upon its groundbreaking special effects, visuals, writing, cinematography, acting, music, and themes, and introduce many more ideas that will make us, as a society, think. Morbius is the best movie I've ever seen. So beautiful.For the Morbin lovers, keep on Morbin. We shall continue to Morb despite this hostile movement against us and the man and film we worship: Jared Leto and Morbius.Infinity/100.",

Morbius did not have a great story. It is engaging but unfortunately it really falls flat. The movie does have some great special effects and CGI use. But the thing that was upsetting was that there were so much stuff in the trailer that got people really hyped then the movie came out and it had none of that stuff which wrecked the movie. The main villain is not at all scary, menacing, intimidating or terrifying he was pretty lame but funny! The side characters also had nothing to do in the movie it's like the Director didn't know what to do with them so they are kinda just there.Jared Leto takes on the role of Morbius and I am not a fan of him at all but he does to a good job playing Morbius playing the sick man who has hope for a cure then playing a man that is scared of what he became well also playing a monster. Matt Smith plays Morbius's best friend and main villain he does make him charming and funny but not much else. Tyrese Gibson plays a cop who has nothing to do in the movie he is just there. And Adria Arjona plays the love interest she is the only other character in the movie that is interesting and has some character development.Overall I don't think this movie was bad but it wasn't good either it just there.",

Otherwise, all the other actors were doing ok.I see what Sony is doing, and I wanna say this: Dear Sony, LISTEN TO MARVEL!! And stop trying to act like you got it. You don't. Marvel knows better.

This film doesn't seem like it was made to be a one time outstanding amazing film, it felt more like a good solid film that you could rewatch and that it's building up to something bigger.

    "text": "In October of 1971, the anti-hero then villain Morbius was debuted in The Amazing Spider-Man #101. This is when the world was introduced to Dr. Michael Morbius who over the years has developed quite the following, even when teaming up with Spidey, Blade, Dr. Strange and many others but eventually returning to his darker roots. This introduced the world to one of the most brutal killers that ever graced the MARVEL pages, from 1974-75 he would get his own book and over a period of 16 years would be a guest in various books up until 1993. The summer of '93 \"Rise of the Midnight Sons\" crossover story arc which ran for 32 issues reintroduced the world to his vampiric charm.Now we fast forward to 2022, where superheroes are a dime a dozen but still have the going power to fill seats. As Vampire films are a popular sub category in the horror genre, it seems that Morbius will fit right in as a multifaceted superhero feature, sadly only as a PG-13 entry and running at 104 minutes. After my first initial viewing, I was excited to see one of my favourite characters come to life on the big screen but, after a second watch I did notice not one or two but several discrepancies that bordered on \"camp\". I also had some issues with his origins and even a slight bit confusing post scene which I will address without taking anything way from the film itself.Dr. Michael Morbius, is played by noneother than the multi-talented indie film favourite Jared Leto who is in his first ever big budget starring role. Leto who is also a vampire enthusiast, also plays the dual role of a producer in the film as well. Another star of the film is noneother than \"The Doctor\" himself, Matt Smith (Doctor Who & The Crown) who plays Morbius' best friend \"Milo\". Jared Harris known for his roles in such TV and Film hits as (Sherlock Holmes and The Crown) plays Dr. Emil Nicholas who helped raise and care for both \"Milo\" and Morbius during their early years. Adria Arjona plays his fianc\u00e9e and lab assistant, Martine Bancroft. The film starts out with a much older Morbius in South America seeking the cure for his illness, which involves a plethora of vampire bats and a blade across the palm. Its a quick intro, which I personally thought should have been placed elsewhere in the film. We are then introduced to a young Michael Morbius, sick and bedridden. This is also where his life takes a turn when he meets his new bed fellow \"Milo\", who becomes his best friend. During this time, we begin to see the brilliance that young Morbius has even though his illness is a major influence he pushes on through the bullying and the isolation. His friendship with \"Milo\" blossoms until he is taken to a school for the gifted, the two stay in touch as Michael continues learning and slowly becomes a highly respected and Nobel Prize-winning biologist specializing in the field of human and animal biology with a medical degree in hematology. By this time, he has been introduced to the beautiful and equally brilliant , Martine Bancroft who works alongside him trying to find the cure that is slowly killing both Michael and \"Milo\". As the story drives on, a cure seems to be close at hand ergo we sync back up to the opening sequence and are now all caught up with the origin of how and why.Now, once the action kicked in...the Vampire in me smiled and began to get invested. The CGI was done well, although I am a fan of practical effects I feel that they nailed the look and the mannerisms of Morbius as \"The Living Vampire\". The Venom-isque fighting scenes were cool to see but I think they relied too much on the CGI for the vampire sequences and should have focused more on Leto's performance and allowed the audience to see where he wanted to take us the viewers. Something else that as a horror fan that I personally got a kick out of was the \"easter eggs\" from different classic vampire films that were placed throughout the film. I think the villain even though he was created especially for the film, was a bit too campy. He did have his moments and had a cool vampire look.I personally feel the backstory was rushed, especially the childhood and the exclusion of certain characters and the addition of others was in no way needed and honestly it felt like the writers really didn't get or like the original source material. This is a dark story, it always has been and trying to make it a PG-13 when SONY and MARVEL's Deadpool had a Rated R, so why would a horror not be? The film took two years to film and they had members of Ridley Scott's team and the team who worked on the CGI for the Avengers films and it shows that there was heart put into it. And I honestly loved this film but it just rushed altogether and ends a bit short.As I said before the end post scene that included Michael Keaton is overtly confusing (as Leto himself publicly hinted at the Sinister Six) as the original members were subdued and \"converted\" in \"Spiderman - No Way Home\". As all comic book fans know Morbius himself had NOTHING to do with the Six, so I suppose we will have to see exactly what SONY has in mind. They also poke fun at Venom at one point in the film, which was fun but weird. Its so fast, if you don't listen for it you could miss it. I personally would love to see a \"Midnight Suns\" Trilogy if they could team up again with MARVEL and grab some loaner characters that would make for a awesome story arc.All in all, I enjoyed sinking my teeth into this incarnation of one of MARVEL's Anti-heroes. I have already pre-ordered my copy and you should too. Its great fun and a worthy addition to the Spidey-Verse collection as well as your horror movie Vampire collection, I mean let's face it Jared Leto makes for one badass and sexy vampire.",

    "text": "For Venom and Marvel fans who love CGI action, Morbius is a total blast! To be practical though, it'll probably go down as one of the worst Marvel movies that have been designed and shot for many noticeable reasons. Everybody just seems to miss the fact that it's reasonably entertaining, and the action sequences are consuming with jump-scares and vampire-themed chases.The specific problem with the bloodsucking action scenes that eventually lower the enjoyment of the movie are all the moments where the blood is kept at a mild limit. This was obviously done to avoid a more mature rating so there would be more audiences in the theatres, but seriously, bloody superhero-related movies like Deadpool and Logan usually deserve more credit and fame. It doesn't get anywhere more violent than Venom, but the CGI work is still worth going to the cinemas for.When you're watching it, a lot of the details and themes make it obvious that the actual execution with decent direction, cinematography, editing and sound is what's surprisingly done well. Reading it as a book or something, it has an extremely flat idea for the story and the screenwriting is just terrible. Jared Leto is an excellent vampire-superhero and Matt Smith is equally as brilliant in the opposite-to-the-protagonist role, but they truly deserve to participate in better material.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",

Morbius is nice easy to watch short Marvel film. Nothing spectacular, but also nothing as boring and pretentious as Eternals. The movie has an easy to follow story, some light bits of comedy, a love interest, and some fight scenes like any other Marvel movie. You don't need to invest too much into this to enjoy it. My only criticism is during the flying scenes the effects are a bit jarring to watch. Other than that I liked Leto and Matt Smiths performance in this movie. A nice and simple 6.5/7 out of 10 movie.",

    "text": "Morbius is not a masterpiece and it never intended to be one. It is a fun, well directed film that takes the bet to explore a more mature, horror like universe and it's truly refreshing. Jared Leto nails his role and the action is well choreographed. It's pure entertainment and it gives a good glimpse at what an Amazing Spider-man 3 could be. Now I know it's definitely not what the other marvel movies are but in my opinion it is much better than the Venom movies and it manages to tell a good story from beginning to end. And I'm myself surprised to write a good review about this film for I never thought it would be that good judging the reviews saying the movie doesn't offer anything and gosh, I'm so happy I went to verify that myself. The movie again is far from being a Spider-man No Way Home but it truly manages to never be boring and brings tension like no other Sony/Marvel film before. To understand why the reviews are negative, you need to watch the post credit scenes because yes... They don't make any sense but... It can be corrected and honestly, it doesn't stop the film from its success in being a pure entertainment product. So, yes, don't believe the negative reviews and ratings because if you're looking for a fun film for your Saturday night, it may be worth it and you won't regret making your own opinion about this movie that I judge ballsy and fun.",

    "text": "This movie is not nearly as bad as some reviews are saying, it was better than I expected. It told the story of Dr. Michael Morbius and how he ended up like he is, I thought it was good at doing that. I can say this is not Leto's best, I feel he could have done better to add to the character, in fact all the acting was a little bland, like nobody was into it. So maybe it could have been better with a different director, sometimes you can feel when a director just doesn't get the best out of the actors, I felt that. With that said, it was still an enjoyable movie for me, and I think non comic book fans with zero expectation will enjoy this even more. Some people were expecting way too much out of this movie and probably wouldn't be happy unless Spider-Man showed up. I mean we are talking Morbius, and I thought this was better than the last Venom which just blew the Carnage appearance. This movie had little to work with and did better.This was a fine set up movie for Morbius, obviously there is more to come, maybe a movie in alternate universe with an Andrew Garfield Spider-Man and Tom Hardy Venom. I do think this will be the last standalone movie for Morbius, but who knows.",

Eye rolling even.It wasn't the worst film I've ever seen, but it was super underwhelming and lazily crammed together.I couldn't say I'd ever tell someone they need to go see this, out of fear they'd want to strangle me. LolIf I didn't have an affinity for the character from reading comics my whole life, I think i would have absolutely hated it but that love got me through it.I wish I had better things to say, but it's a pretty mediocre film that deserved to be better. Leto deserves it to be better as well.The end credits stuff is more entertaining than the actual film. At least they left me with something.Kinda bummed.",

The story was alright and seemed to jump around in a weird order. I felt lost a few times trying to figure where in the story I was. At one hour and forty-five minutes, the timing felt way too long. I got bored and by the time the parts that seemed to give the movie substance, I was over it and couldn't wait for the film to end. I also disliked the whole villain aspect. He never seemed convincing and lacked any true hate for the character.The only reason I can justify giving this film a six is because visually the film was awesome, the sound along with the score was incredible, and the use of echolocation in the characters was interesting.Overall, I would recommend seeing this film on cheap night, or possibly even waiting for it to home release. The base of the film was good, but it failed to grasp any true traction. The length of the film would've been good if the story was actually interesting. Visually stunning and the soundtrack was actually amazing.Thank you for taking the time to read my review and I hope it helps you make a decision on it.Until next time.... Enjoy the show!",

Their friendship can truly be felt as if it two real friends were going through turmoil.The soundtrack of Morbius were like the final bells ringing the end of school, every sound and each song is carefully crafted to convey the most captivating emotion, each symphony forcefully releases dopamine from my mind and I can not get enough of this film. To match this, CGI constructed to such perfection that it brought tears to my eyes every single instance Morbius would 'morb out' and go savage on his enemies, his ability to carefully plan out strategies and execute them flawlessly, clearly connotes an ability that would rival the likes of Thanos.Narrative, never in my existence have I sat through 104 minutes of pure bliss, everything makes sense, everything happens for a reason, and everything has consequences. It is not just a movie, It is perfection on screen.I am vividly awaiting Morbius 2 and am thoroughly excited to witness him morb out on his enemies, once again!#morbiussweep #onemorbilliondollars.",

I hope so.Critics havent been too kind to this film but like I always say \"If I had listened to critics then half of the movies I love that they hate I wouldnt have watched\" and this is another to add on the list of movies that I enjoy that they dont like.",

    "text": "This movie is not a movie. There are few words to describe the havoc that this movie is, there is no characterization of the characters, the scenes that should be tragic are not precisely because they do not tell you anything about the characters, the fight scenes are a unique confusion, the CGI is good in some places while in others it seems that they have applied filters of Instagram, the music is apt nothing to say but not memorable and the moments of slow motion personally I enjoyed them only during the fight scenes too bad that you do not understand anything anyway. These were the main flaws but let's not forget the two biggest flaws, the post-credits scene and the terrible resemblance to Venom 2. The post-credits scene is meaningless and confuses the average viewer even more, instead I noticed that in some parts, especially a small twist towards the end, the movie is very but very similar to Venom 2 the only difference is that in this movie there are no bad jokes. I'm afraid of the next Sony products, this movie was a pure disappointment and you can see that it was the product of a thousand changes in progress, I remember that the first trailer dates back almost 3 years ago and in all this time they have done nothing but make more confusion within the film.",

    "text": "MORBIUS, starring Jared Leto as the titular character of DOCTOR MICHAEL J. MORBIUS aka MORBIUS is a masterpiece of filmmaking. This is the first 11/10 movie to exist, in fact, and if you disagree, you're wrong. It made 10 Morbillion dollars at the Morbox Office, which makes it the highest grossing movie ever of all time. It pleased audiences everywhere with its intricate storytelling, deep t h e m e s , and most of all, the performance of a lifetime from Jared Leto as DOCTOR MICHAEL J. MORBIUS himself.I watched this movie 837 times in the theater. I quit my job so I could watch this movie more times, but it was worth it for MORBIUS. I think, after seeing it this many times, I am starting to see a little of myself in the protagonist as well. My wife gets mad at me when I tell her I have the powers of MORBIUS, saying doubtful statements such as \"you are not a vampire\" and \"you cannot fly\" and \"I am leaving you and taking the kids\" but I don't care. She doesn't understand. This is the experience of a lifetime. Do yourself a favor and support this movie so we can get a MORBIUS 2 and a INTO THE MORBIVERSE in the future. I personally bought three - one for the Father, the Son, and the Holy MORBIUS.After you watch this movie, you will be glad you met DOCTOR MICHAEL J. MORBIUS.",

Meaning there is a massive amount of source material they could have derived from to make an incredible movie.But. I have issue with the fact that the whole film felt too familiar I kept saying to the people I was there with that it felt like a rip off of Dracula Untold. Some of the scenes were almost direct copies of stuff in that film, but in a film that wasn't quite as good or original. Once we left the theater. I looked up the movie, wondering if I could find similarity.. only to realize it's the same writers.Which made me wonder did they just chose to use the cliff notes from their superior vampire film, instead of taking the time to create something new.Now, if you've not seen Dracula Untold, or at least not as many times as I have, maybe this isn't a real issue.. but even without that, it still is a weak use of a really cool character and would have been better in another group of writers hands.",

I enjoyed the awakening of powers within Morbius cannot wait to see the next film in this series.Jared Leto is one of the best actors in Hollywood and it shows.Most superhero archetypes play semi flawed characters in personality only but Leto delivers a character flawed in a variety ways, on the edge of a darkness that very few characters can go within this world.This movie did not disappoint.As someone who writes screenplays, I respect the work done to bring this film to life.The whole cast was great and each character shined!The effects were amazing, especially as Morbius began tapping into all his powers.This is the dark film that many of us have been waiting for and can appreciate solely on a great story.",

Average.The after credit scenes were not as bad as they claimed they are, they were just making a connection with them so they were fine, also, you dont have to sit through the credits to watch them so it was fine.I hope i helped, have a nice day.",

It explained fully the background and the origin of the character itself as well as the connections between marvel and him. The excitement of horrors and extremely bloody scenes have brought up another level of marvel movies. The ending is a bit disappointing and is easily predictable by viewers. Nether less, it is a marvel movie so seat back and enjoy .",

Everything about this movie was dumb. I never liked the fact that Sony turning Venom and Morbius into PG-13 movies just so they can become part of the MCU instead of making their own cinematic universe. These movies would be ATLEAST be enjoyable if it was rated R, but no, PG-13 provides more money. This movie was way worst than Venom and Venom: Let There Be Carnage.

Leto was much better in this film than as the Joker in \"Suicide Squad\" (I actually found his Joker to be interesting and would liked to have seen more character development in that particular case).The acting was fine for this type of film, script was better than expected for a B movie, and the special effects were good - without being over the top. It was, however, rather predictable and there were definitely no surprises or significant twists. All-in-all it was a fun watch, worth the price of admission, but nothing special.",

However the amazing moments make up for it every time Matt Smith and Jared Leto on screen together it is a amazing scene and they are on screen together quite a lot. There are some story details that drag on and it is kind of a lackluster origin story. On the other hand if you look at it for what it is and admire the amazing action scenes then it is a great movie.

    "text": "I actually copied and pasted this from ethanbresnett's review.. couldnt have said it any betterMorbius is one of those rare films that pretty much gets everything wrong.The story, the character development, the action... everything about it felt very dated and messy, with practically no redeeming qualities to be found anywhere.There was no depth to any of the characters which made it so hard to get invested in what was going on. In truth I don't think any of the performances were bad per se, but they were all so bland.It didn't help the characters that the writing was so poor. They had no faith in the audience at all, spoon feeding us exposition in the most clunky ways imaginable.The action was truly dreadful. It was either in super slow-mo which exposed the poor CGI, or it was at super speed to the point you were just watching blurs.The story was so basic and formulaic. I hate to say it but I was actually bored watching it. The pacing also felt very off, as the film came to a very abrupt end, before subjecting us to some bonkers credits scenes.I can forgive bad writing. I can forgive bad action. I can forgive a weak plot. But there is one thing in a film I can't forgive and that is when it leaves me bored. As a result Morbius scores a measly 3/10.",

It's not going to break many records (if any), but it was enjoyable to see a relatively unknown Marvel character come to the big screen.

This movie will easily inspire generations of young minds and benefit society for years to come. The soundtrack and cinematography are S tier.

I know most critics don't like comic book films but the vitriol directed at Morbius was insane. And the funny thing is that the reality is literally the opposite of what u read. The story is in fact amazing. It's dark, because it's about an anti-hero vampire. So yes, it's heavy. But that's the point. Also, it isn't \"confusing blurry cgi\" it's effective special effects capturing two vampires fighting. It's hard to understand why I have to explain that. Also they even go out of their way to complain about the post credits scenes which are only \"stupid and confusing\" if you are stupid or didn't want watch Spider-Man no way home.In Short the movie is amazing. The action is awesome. The special effects amazing and they perfectly captured Morbius from the old comics.The only way u can't enjoy this film is if you are trying to or if you forgot what comic book movies are all about. I'm going back next weekend and can't wait to see it again!",

The pace is good in the first two acts, however in the final act the movie is shaken by re-recordings which becomes evident as there are scenes out of place. Not to mention the dialogue...\nThe action is weak: strange effects, sloppy editing, terrible choreography and unnecessary slow motions, joined by an unoriginal soundtrack.Generally performances were good Jared Leto is far from being the movie's problem and Matt Smith is wronged by lack of character development (villain).Althoug enterteining this film suffers from poor writing, sloppy editing, post production issues and the need to rush everything to promote future projects (same old mistakes).

    "text": "It's not so much that it's bad, it's that it was so unnecessary. Take the most cliched trope of any action flick and tie those all together loosely and you have this mess of a flick. It really has no idea what it is, much like the good Doctor. Is he a vampire? Is he human? A Doctor Vampire? I'm certain there are moments in here that need to be flesh out more, but it relies on some really horrific moments of on-the-nose dialogue possible \"We need to get you help?\" \"I am a monster\" \"What did I do?!\" and so forth. It's cringey to see someone like director Daniel Espinosa fall to this level. A guy who has done safer flicks like \"Safe House\" or \"Child 44\" This was maybe too safe.Now I don't want to blast this flick like others have. You just want more for talents like Jared Leto or Matt Smith. Or even discount Eiza Gonzalez (who will probably be lambasted on this week's released \"Ambulance\"). But you can't throw this at the screen and expect people to just go along with it.Here's the story: Doctor tries to save himself and his buddy by splicing his DNA with a bat's. Apparently bat DNA can process blood the way their human bodies are failing at. Unfortunately the side effect is that they thirst for blood and must maintain that hunger to survive. Duh. Right off the bat (pun intended) a brilliant doctor who doesn't know this is an idiot. The rest is just more painful. As they are now adults and close to dying, they inject themselves with the serum. And the rest writes itself. You know they will have differing views of their new found \"powers\" And, therefore, battle each other out. More stomach churning are the police who tail the doctor yet aren't in disbelief of the events that are in front of them. They act as if this is normal (perhaps in New York it is). The audience won't buy it.All in all, this was just a blah experience. It's not terrible. Just so very unnecessary.Worst is when the powers that be give you the end credit cut scene that brace you for another installment. I find it arrogant that we would want another one of these.This is a very disjointed movie that has no clue where it's going.",

Even with a much lower expectation, the movie barely delivers. Somehow its mash up of horror, drama, and superhero action does not add well The trailer promised an interesting character similar to Robert Pattinson's Batman, where the character struggles to find his place, but the movie skips the hero's journey altogether, and does not have any clear theme. Jared Leto is a great actor, but there is not enough material for him to use all his talents. His character's bond with Jared Harris' character is not well developed, and neither is relationship with Matt Harris. His romantic interest, which is supposed to provide a heart to the story seems forced. This is probably due to bad writing. The fight scenes are actually quite good, and different, though too few. If they opted to make the movie darker, and more horror oriented, it could have worked (maybe). Anyway, the movie has soooooo much to improve, and even for an escapist, unintellectually stimulating movie, it is not that fun to watch either.",

I also saw The Batman recently.. and I actually found Morbius much more enjoyable to watch. Batman was pretty cheesy to me.So I was pretty shocked afterward to see how poorly rated the movie is. Yes the movie ended too soon.. it felt like it didn't have much of an ending. However I just took that to mean that it's a simple origin story setting up future movies. Admittedly that is a lazy approach but it's better than feeling like the movies being stretched too long with useless filler.. which I find the case with many films.So if you want to see a really fun movie with exceptional sound and visuals, Morbius fits the bill for me. Just don't expect a masterpiece or a profound story.. it's clearly intended to be the first of many of the character (although given the abysmal ratings maybe that won't happen as they intended)",

The story is basic, the plot and the characters could be further developed, but the director preferred to keep everything simple. There are some gaps in the story of the movie. As it progresses they explain it to you but you feel that some details are missing to give it a little more flavor in the climax moments of the movie.Jared leto was an incredible performance. You can't ask for less from an excellent actor. Despite the bad reviews they have of the famous places, Morbius is a project that well worked can open schemes to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The Blade vs. Morbius showdown would be unique in the CINEMA.",

Morbius leads him to do what he does, however, as the movie progresses it gets worse, until he crashes. An exaggerated use of cgi that clashes with the aesthetics of the film, the character development is empty, the basic motivations, the dialogues practically a couple of sentences in one scene, a couple of sentences in another... the beginning of the film, i was enjoying it, but when it was over, I didn't know what to think... I don't know if many scenes were removed in the edition, or because of the problems of the pandemic it was not possible to record everything that was wanted, but this film lacked in many scenes, lack of development of the characters, it lacked a better integration of the logic of how the elements of the film worked... in general it is an entertaining film, but it becomes ridiculous at times. I feel sorry for the final result of this one, because Jared Letto's performance is quite good, but the others are bad, especially the female partner of Dr. Morbius, a basic action, with simplistic motivations and without deep development of these. Honestly, I think it could have been a good movie, but it just wasn't. Maybe in the future the director's cut will come out and we'll see what we deserved, but for now it's just one more of the bunch... I recommend going to see it if there isn't much else to do, and you don't go with a critical attitude, but if you want to see one good movie, better stay home.",

You have Morbius, a new made vampire that needs to drink human blood to live. You could explore this in so many ways, like trying to drink blood from animals, buying blood from blood bank and making needing people dying because lack of blood packs, leading to \"I will drink blood from bad people\". But they decided that trowing a blurred colored ball is more interesting. Side characters are empty as well.This movie is so boring that is more enjoyable to do the dishes.",

    "text": "An old fashioned Saturday-matinee, b-list, Gothic horror-flick riddled with vampire tropes built around the classic Jekyll & Hyde story. There is a whiff of Cain and Abel with brotherhood, favourite son and jealousy playing a role, with the package wrapped in a superficial comic book veneer.On those terms, it is acceptable, but as a $75M blockbuster it fails. Sure the visuals are fabulous with the 'de rigueur' CGI, but the plot is gauche, linear and predictable.Matt Smith is good as the antagonist and Adria Arjona (hitherto unknown to me) does well, but her part is mostly relegated to damsel in distress.Not a very good movie, far from the worst this year, but a disappointment considering the hyped up expectation.",

Then once again today still illegally on soap2day but now at least I could see and hear it all. This movie was a visual treat, bright colors thrown at you and great effects. Let me put aside my feelings for Sony trying to cash in with this movie. Or the fact that Morbius would never team up with anyone doing bad like the vulture guy. This movie was GOOD! I already love vampire movies and superhero's so the combo was great! This movie was at least worthy of between 6 and 8 stars. Anyone rating it lower is just lying or being hateful. Drama, love, mystery ending. What more could you ask for. I am sad everyone else does not feel the same as I do in watching this movie. That means pt.2 will not come out until after spider woman. I definitely do not want to see that. I love this movie and will continue re-watching it because it was that good. Next movie I will be front row in the theaters to see! I do think Venom should have stayed in his lane and not crossed over. I love Venom and Morbius, SEPARATELY!",

The foolish morons nearby whom berated me for merely being a connoisseur of films, the ingrates who left the film because they could not differentiate perfection from rubbish, and finally the wannabe and so called 'critics' who give this film any less than 10 out of 10 stars, you can all go defecate on the streets, just like the barbarians and animals you are. I would say this film can even go on par with The Fast and Furious motion pictures. Overall, this movie truly deserves a perfect rating, if possible, beyond the normal standard of perfection, and beyond limitation. I am a difficult man to please, yet I am astounded by this piece of media, therefore, you can rest easy knowing this movie is well worth the price and your time. CHEERS. It's Morbin' Time.",

What it doesn't have is the charm of Tom Hardy arguing with himself and doing his impression of Jim Carey in The Mask.What you get instead is a passable but drab rendition of a mid nineties comic book movie, think way short of a Blade but better than a Spawn. Frustratingly, there are seeds of a much better movie here had the filmmakers invested the time in developing any of the threads they have going on. There is some actually quite gruesome body horror on show (Matt Smith was made for it) and had they leaned into it a bit more we could have had a genuinely unique superhero flick on our hands. There is also an interesting gothic tragedy buried in there but Morbius and best friend Loxias relationship is left pitifully underdeveloped so their parting of ways means nothing to the viewer. The script really needed to spend more time on hammering home their closeness and less on forcing a pointless romance with a female colleague. They may as well of put up some text on screen saying, \"look Morbius is just FRIENDS with another guy OK, there's nothing gay going on there relax.\"The film isn't a complete disaster and Leto does a pretty good job of giving Michael some personality but the absence of any meaningful stakes leads to a fairly boring hour and a half with the whole thing feeling like something Sony wanted to get out the way in their quest for some sort of team up movie in the future.",

    "title": "A vampire movie with hardly any blood does not provide much tension or entertainment",
    "rating": 3,
    "date": "2022-04-19",
    "text": "Morbius is a new action thriller directed by Daniel Espinosa, the director of Life and Safe House. The film is about biochemist Dr. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto). He suffers from a very rare blood disease, for which he is trying to make a medicine to cure himself and others who suffer from the same disease. He thinks he can make the medicine with the blood of vampire bats, but after a self-test with this drug, he turns himself into a living vampire.With this film, Marvel teamed up with Sony to take their superhero film series to a more mature level, introducing horror creatures like vampires into their series. Unfortunately, she doesn't seem to dare to cross this line with the Marvel film series and really come up with 16+ films. In this vampire movie, for example, hardly any real blood comes out, because the main character chooses to use artificial blue blood. When a vampire is chasing after a human, to drink his blood, these scenes are filmed too moving and too dark. This makes it difficult to follow what happens to the victims until they end up dead on the ground even with no real obvious blood wounds. The blood that you occasionally see on some victims comes across as unrealistic because of the too dark color.For example, they seem to try to keep the film child-friendly, despite it being sold as a 16+ film in some countries and making it difficult for younger teenagers to watch the film. Other teen vampire movies like even Twilight went more in the horror direction with the blood consumption and vampire actions. The horror moments that appear in the film are mainly standard clich\u00e9s from horror films, which are on the predictable side due to their familiarity and if not really scary or exciting. The story continues at a rushed pace, jumping from place to place alone so that the story can move forward. The story is also on the predictable side, which allows you as a viewer to predict what is about to come and so you can get ahead of the story. Despite the fast pace, the trite story is still long-winded and so uninteresting. In addition to its own trite story, the film also copies moments from other films such as Batman Begins and almost loses its originality. References that the film makes to other Sony Marvel films also make the film unnecessarily complicated, because it is sometimes difficult to understand in which film series this film is set. The scenes during the credits only make this more chaotic, so that some good previous films from the Marvel series can now also come across as a little less. The visual effects don't look all that believable either. When someone changes into his vampire form, it sometimes seems like a simple snapchat filter or a cheap layer of makeup. When characters use their powers, it resembles scenes from old video games from older game consoles such as the Playstation 2. The fact that the superpowers are further placed around the characters with CGI is also clearly visible, but what the characters do exactly remains unclear. In the end battle it seems like two CGI clouds keep flying against each other until there is a winner. The acting is also nothing special. Despite the lesser script, Jared Leto doesn't even add much uniqueness to the film. In his earlier acting work, he still knew what to do with his film roles, so that you remembered the character played by him after this film. His characters are very repetitive here when, for example, he drinks the artificial blood from blood bags. The rest of the film cast doesn't get much to work with either. Matt Smith manages to steal the movie as the movie's most interesting character, but other great ones like Jared Harris and Michael Keaton actually waste their time and acting talent more in this movie.",

    "text": "So, is Morbius as bad as the critics claim. I would like to differ to that opinion. Yes, you cannot compare it to movies like Black Panther, Avengers or even any Spider-Man MCU movie but it is an entertaining movie. I would say it's better than a lot of those mediocre superhero movies. Yeah the post-credits don't make sense but that's not the movie right. I like the acting by both Matt Smith and Jared Leto, their chemistry is great. Jared Leto gave his all. The acts are not that well differentiated but the fight sequences are great especially the slowed ones, it just feels like an immersive experience. I like the way the powers of vampires are portrayed. The movie feels like a typical superhero movie with a backstory and a proper conclusion. I don't know what the fuss is all about. Though yeah if you expect an avengers level movie you will be disappointed a lot but you know not to expect that it's a low-budget superhero movie. I hope my opinion makes you alteast try you watch that on an ott and not on the cinema. But well let's see what Sony can do.",

Jared Leto was ehh okay, but not that good as Morbius. Daniel Espinosa is a good director from his previous films, but this movie he made was a little way off, probably cause of Jared if I might add. It should've been Ian Somerhalder that could play the role of Morbius. I think that would be a perfect role for Ian, cause he did an amazing job playing Damon Salvatore from Vampire Diaries. Morbius was not that good like the Venom movies with Tom Hardy. And the problem is that Sony had to go on and spoil the ending post credits! And the CGI effects was pretty messed up and the writing was bad and Matt Smith was pretty funny with his part. What the hell, Sony? Thanks for ruining the film, butt holes!",

    "text": "Yeah it's just as bad, maybe even worse than everyone's saying. It's a film farted out by Sony as a shameless attempt at starting their own marvel universe by picking an unknown character and quickly dumping out a crappy film to capitalize on the Batman hype. I am being 100% truthful and honest with you this movie had barely any effort put into it at all, it just feels like a complete cashgrab, this is the superhero movie equivalent of a straight to VOD late career Bruce Willis movie.Okay, let's start with the positives.... uhhhh.... I guess the production design was okay? It wasn't really shot all too poorly, I think? I mean there are indeed some really flat shots and ugly sequences but it's not all bad, and that's where the list of positives end.Now let me be clear: I hate writing super negative reviews because it feels like I'm bullying the people who worked on this, movies are hard to make and all, but I have next to no sympathy for studio cashgrab movies they had the budget to make it good and took the easy way out, I do feel bad for Jared Leto and Matt Smith, I love Matt, and I want him to be in better stuff, but he's awful in this. I have a really hard time blaming Leto and Smith for their bad performances because it honestly doesn't entirely feel like their fault, rather it feels as though the writers are to blame. The script is dinosaur dung incarnate, I have no idea how someone proof read this and said \"yeah that's good,\" Morbius and Milo have 0 character whatsoever, no defining character traits, no development, no depth, not even a motive, no that's not a joke they have no motive whatsoever. Milo was crippled as a kid and he was bullied as a kid now he wants vampire powers so he can walk and kill people who aren't crippled? I say this as a question because that's what I thought his motive was until it just changed at the middle, he just becomes a bad guy who wants to kill Morbius for some unspoken reason; I assume it's because Morbius didn't give him the serum when he asked for it, but not only is this poorly conveyed to the viewer, but it's such petty drama and makes his character look like a giant child.Morbius is just a doctor guy I honestly don't know what his goal even is or who he's supposed to be, he has a love interest but the romance is soooo forced, him and his lady friend share 3 scenes together, kiss, and that's it. They have 0 reason to be together at all, and the woman who plays his lady friend was a bad actress as well. There's two detective characters who they keep cutting back to but they're completely pointless, in fact, they just forget about them by the end of the movie. The \"jokes\" in this movie were hilarious, so hilarious in fact, that whenever they said a joke, NOBODY in my theater laughed. I think I heard a guy cough once. And talk about cliche, holy crap this movie follows that marvel formula to a tee, even ending with that same goddamn giant cgi epilepsy fight, but this time it's so unbelievably lame and uninspired, and there's no reason for it to happen at all. The cgi was terrible, it might've been worse than Venom, it feels so tryhardy, like this movie really wants you to think it looks cooler than it actually does. Some really goofy stuff happens in this movie as well but it's so far and few between that it makes it so you can't even watch it in the same way as Venom. Characters will die and it makes no impact at all because they aren't fleshed out in the slightest, and don't get me started on Morbius's powers, he can like glide on wind or something, he can't do it when he needs to fly off a building but he can fly... in front of a train? What? And even though he says he has \"bat sonar\" it's just super hearing, like do the writers even know what sonar is? The ending in this movie was horrible sequel bait nonsense, it was completely unsatisfying and just stupid this whole movie is so stupid and it doesn't even know it.Do not waste your time or money viewing this piece of trash, it is boring nonsense from start to finish, it not a so bad it's good movie like venom, more of a so pathetic it's dull type of movie.",

Although many movies with low ratings do turn out bad but many don't as well.This movie had a very dark and grey vibe to it, kinda like The Wolfman 2010. The CGI was definitely 10/10, I was very impressed as I love CGI. My favorite parts of the movie was the friend relationship between Michael and Milo change. I was never a fan of Jared Leto but he did a good job on his character.Yes there's a few question marks in the movie as most do but isn't watching a movie all about being entertained? I was very entertained and wish the movie was longer. It woud have been good to have some more gore and blood for such a movie.

    "text": "Yeah it's just as bad as you've heard it is. Funny at points but really really bad. The writing feels very half baked as if the writers didn't finish the story and just went with what was written. Hell, Leto kills the villain in the last like minute of the movie. No kind of calm after. The movie just ends there. It feels like they wanted to do more but were just too lazy to do it. The actual story is incredibly boring and confusing. Scenes just kind of happen with a very thin reasoning for it. The film doesn't truly know what it wants to be. There really aren't any characters here. No one has any sort of character journey or arc. They just do things because the plot tells them to. Matt Smith's goal in the movie is just that he wants to kill people. This isn't established at all in the flashbacks or even in the present day. He just wants to. Speaking of Matt Smith, he is easily my favorite aspect of the movie. Call if Doctor Who Bias but Matt Smith knew what this movie should have been. A goofy comic book movie and he absolutely 100% delivers on that. His presence and performance genuinely made this film so much easier to get through and his performance is truly great even if he has no character. Jared Leto is just kind of there. His performance really isn't good or bad. Not worth doing all of that awful method acting he was doing for this movie. The post credit scene is probably one of if not the worst post credit scenes ever made. It completely character assassinated Michael Keaton's Vulture in the span of 30 seconds and it feels like an afterthought and that they filmed it the day before the movie released. If you were to see this movie, watch it with friends. It's probably more enjoyable that way because you'll most likely being making fun of it the whole time.",

And lets face it, half of the Marvel movies (at least) are totally unremarkable and uninspired. The only real difference between this movie and those is that Morbius (the character) doesn't have millions of rabid fans who blindly buy tickets and praise everything with his name on it.",

    "text": "No spoilers here. I watched this in Dolby Cinema and WOW!! From start to finish this was very enjoyable for me and my family, and they are not that into the marvel universe like me. This stands on its own as a movie even if you're not invested in the marvel stories. And shout out to Matt Smith who gave such a fantastic performance I think he deserves some kind of award. Jared Leto was also fantastic so I'm really finding it difficult to see what people didn't like about the movie. But I have a few guesses which I will list below.1. It's way less comical and cheesy than other marvel films (which I loved for a change) and is more on the serious side.2. This is more of a vampire film than the typical marvel superhero style (which I also loved)!3. It aims for something completely different than what Marvel usually does and again, I loved that about the movie.If you're looking for typical goofy marvel banter and don't enjoy the more serious side of comic book movies, this may not be for you. But if you want to see a kick ass vampire origin story with some great acting, then this is for sure a must see! I can't wait to rewatch this as I found it greatly entertaining. If you want to let people who look at their phone every 5 minutes, get up and go to the bathroom 2-3 times during the movie and step out to answer phone calls, then come back in barely knowing what's happened in the movie, if you want THAT kind of person telling you if a movie is good or not, I pray for you. Because no the movie isn't perfect, but it is by far nowhere near the ratings on this site. Matt Smith and Jared Letos performances alone are worth watching. So go see it for yourself and stop letting idiots keep you from enjoying movies!",

Between his goofy take on the Joker, his terrible Mario brother impression in \"House of Gucci\" and this dud of a movie, I think it's safe to say that he has some work to do if he wants to get back in the game.The first half hour of this movie is somewhat decent. Nothing great. When Michael Morbius gets his powers, it goes downhill. There's basically no plot to be spoken of. The CGI is terrible. The villain is just not interesting at all, he has no motive other than a new-found god complex. Matt Smith just looks so bad with the CG face effects.A complete throwaway movie. The best scene is one of the post-credit scenes. Which merely acts as a teaser for more entries into Sony's Spiderverse. Which I'm honestly not too keen on following after this mess.One saving grace is that the movie is pretty short for a superhero adventure so not too much of your time will be wasted if you want to check it out while channel surfing and it pops up on FXM on a Tuesday night next year.",

The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Dr Michael's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - Morbius declining the Pulitzer Prize subtly referencing his personal philosophy which draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature. The real fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of the story, to realise that this is not your everyday Marvel movie, Morbius has a deeper meaning about Life.Every single second of this 4 hour 2 minute thriller was action packed - there were multiple times throughout the film when I forgot that I wasn't actually sitting alone in a cold and dark theatre.As a consequence, people who dislike Morbius aren't that smart - of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the subtle nuance in Dr Morbius' existential forehead tattoo \"Damaged\" which itself is a cryptic reference to Dostoevsky's Russian epic The Brothers Karamazov. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated \"critics\" scratching their heads in confusion as Zack Snyder's genius unfolds itself on their television screens.The only thing that I can think of that's negative about this film is that there weren't enough cameos from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I kept waiting for Dr Strange to open a portal and all my favourite superheroes would walk in like are we some kind of Suicide Squad? Where was Batman and Spiderman?9.9/10.",

What a mess I don't even know where to start, have the writers / director been stuck in the past somehow? I know this was going to be bad but I still wanted to give it a watch, I don't know why I subjected myself to this..Morbius has every bad thing that you would expect from a super hero movie, the CGI is insanely awful (I mean you can see it in the trailer), no single person on the movie is interesting, plain boring characters that you will make zero connections to. It's filled with clich\u00e9s, from the over the top villain, the support blend romance interest (?) of the protagonist, the cheesy detectives who make 2 or 3 appearances and have absolutely no relevance to the story whatsoever, the bad attempts at humor with the vampire jokes...\nWho actually thought that this was a good final product..? I mean considering the good stuff that has been put out lately specially on the super hero genre, how on Earth a big studio with a huge budget makes this atrocity?Nothing going on makes any sense whatsoever, these kind of movies are pure fantasy but usually there's an attempt even if fictional to make sense of the plot and the fantasy bits, but this is plain and simply ridiculous and are you really that psychotic that you witness someone killing 8 people out of the blue and still wish to protect that person without even questioning it, as a medical doctor?Also Jared Leto does a very poor job here, I know he has some great acting skills even though he is not one of my favorites but here he seems to struggle to find the character, he seems dark even before the transformation, but then we are suppose to believe that he grows a conscience and had a hard time accepting what he has done... Or maybe the character is very very poorly written..Either way, putting it short, don't watch, don't support it, I don't know what the end goal was but they failed miserably.",

    "text": "Morbius has a closer kinship to the early 2000s Marvel films than anything released recently, as poor filmmaking decisions surely sink this Sony attempt to latch onto MCU success.The film actually starts out very promising, immediately into the story with no build up and a childhood backstory summed up in a few minutes. Unfortunately this was a precursor for the rest of the film, which also had no build up, causing the the climax to be over without knowing it's even happened.Whilst the first half of the film is enjoyable, without being overly engaging, the last 20-30 minutes unravel anything good, as Morbius is given newfound, unexplained powers to conveniently solve his problems. Not even a single power, but in consecutive scenes a new ability pops up so he can move onto the next inconvenience.The CGI isn't great, and whoever made the decision to add the wisps behind their fast movements, the regular slow-mo, or give the villain the ability to change his face on command, really killed off any seriousness. This film needed that seriousness to be any good.As a villain, Milo goes from a lovely chap to insistent upon murder in a matter of minutes, and whilst Smith plays him well, there is so little to him as a character. Likewise, Leto doesn't do anything wrong in his performance, it's just not a great character. Morbius is hardly one of the A-listers in the Marvel Comics repertoire, but why make a pretty good horror based villain the hero (yet again)?It's fairly evident that the producers had no faith in the film, seeing as how the trailer is broken up with references to Spider-Man (who is not incorporated into the film whatsoever) or Keaton as Vulture, who doesn't appear until the post-credit scenes. That is just weak.",

    "text": "I knew this character belongs in the Marvel Universe but I never knew him well enough to get my excitement boiling for his standalone film. Morbius had its marketing and scheduling issues; it was delayed for multiple times, and my interest which was already floating on the water becomes less and less.Morbius has a simple and mostly, a predictable storyline. Aside from Sam Raimi's Spiderman, remember when you saw those old superhero films from the early 00s and you could just taste the cheesiness and how corny those films were made? Morbius is one of those films that should have been made sooo much earlier.It's a film that is presented in a way like it is made for kids. There isn't anything strong enough to warrant a viewing for adults. Morbius is shallow with story and character developments that aren't well structured, resulting in a lack of depth that would make audience have a hard time comprehending the nature of its story or the motivation of its characters.As the story flows, if there's one thing I'd like to bring to the table, it's this; why does Morbius get to be the good guy and the antagonist is forced to be THE antagonist? I don't get it. Often the film is devoid of any explanations to find a reasonable motivation for a character's intention or why some characters change abruptly over the course of its incoherent story. It's missing its pieces, confusing audience that there's no justification as to why a character becomes what he/she becomes.Did Jared Leto give a good performance as Dr Michael Morbius? Mehhh is the first thought that comes to mind. It's not iconic nor is it awful, it's okay but it seems like everything Leto touches now would either be bad, a flop or receive tons of criticisms from viewers.And I thought the final battle could somehow redeem the already subpar entry. But it didn't, it was in fact, the shortest and laziest final battle I have ever seen in a long, long time. You don't believe me? Time it, time the final battle. It's like the production has been cut out of the budget at the eleventh hour, they had to wrap it the soonest without even giving the film a proper closure \ud83d\ude2d.Now if you ask me, what about the good side of Morbius? Are there any redeemable qualities? Yes. For one, I love how they executed the slo-mo effects. Everytime the film got into slow motion, I thought they were pretty cool and awesome esp during the chase scenes.There's something about the lighting that also impresses me. The blue & red neon-coloured palette did increase the overall quality look of the film, though I dislike the greenish-blue that was mostly used as the film's central colour.In terms of storytelling, probably the only thing that kept me interested is the scientific element and terms they threw at the audience. I could tell that they actually did care about Morbius's origin and I was quite engaged with how they discovered the breakthrough that made what Morbius was later.Verdict: Transported back to the early 00s, Morbius is a superhero film that uses an obsolete formula to tell a story that should have only be told if the materials were fully prepared and ready-to-go. By this point, even an antidote couldn't save Morbius.",

On Tuesday, the night before she was scheduled to go in, I decided to take her to the theater to try and put her nervous mind at ease. We reluctantly chose to view Morbius, and I say 'reluctantly' because we had heard some previously negative reviews. It began with our full interest, but as the picture went on our interest in finishing the movie waned. Around the 1 hour mark my mom got up and walked out. Thinking maybe she was just going to the restroom I remained seated for an additional 10 minutes. Worried about the woman who gave me life, I then also walked to the lobby. I found my mom walking around spryly, more actively than I had seen in years. She told me she couldn't take anymore torture, and was planning to straight up leave but as she left her knees began to feel years younger. We went back in to finish the movie and by the time the credits rolled not only her knees were better, but her glaucoma had cleared up, the arthritis that had nagged her for decades was gone, and my Dad decided to leave my step-mom for her.The next day the surgeon, was astounded. He promptly cancelled the surgery and informed my mom she had the knees of someone 3 times her junior. He immediately asked if we had seen Morbius recently, we said \"of course\".He laughed. I laughed. My mom laughed.10/10.",

    "text": "This is a different take on the Vampire genre, and origin story. We sympathize with a person with a deadly illness, that could happen to any of us, trying to fix himself and find the cure for others. Its a very noble and human ideal to want to Live but also have Compassion.Personally I.d have started the film differently, but history in flashbacks also works, that way you can jump straight to the action at the start (which is what people want these days *sigh*), and leave the background until people are in the thick of the action, in that way, this film feels a BIT -contrived-, but it still works, having the slow bully parts later, so we understand and sympathize with the motivation of the villain: After suffering, one understands the thrill of abusing power against those who deserve punishment, however having -power- corrupts many people. Never lose your Self, just because you can... but, ok, I do love slow burn movies, like -Angel Heart-. With this one, I would have started in the orphanage, and made the rest chronologically make sense... but I.d have made the film a LOT longer. One has to consider its made for today's audience, who are into instant gratification, and greedy for action, as opposed to slow character growth. People don.t have time for that these days, so you get what the majority wants... Hoping for a Directors Cut later, for those who want depth.I am purposely avoiding any MAIN spoilers, because its a movie that people should see, without too many preconceived ideas, or opinions of others, even though IMDB is made for that. To me it was such a great movie, that I have now seen it more than 5 times. Its like with any film, each time you see it, you motive more stuff. I love that... and I love it.Small comic reference: I DID see the comics decades ago and sadly, the artist that drew them, originally, had too BLOCK-Y a style for me. That, and how ugly Morbius looked in them, ruined those comics for me. *ahem* the weird thing is that I have an upturned nose, but his was just exaggerated. I wonder if it was by accident, or if it inspired Michael Jackson look, though. Michael would have LOVED Morbius. Hey! His name IS even -Michael- Morbius. Things that make you go -hmmm-. :-D.",

I watched it last night after hearing all the trash talk about it and found it was actually a pretty good film. Both Jared Leto and Matt Smith were excellent and although all that 'puff-of-smoke' stuff was a bit 'WTF??!!', I'm glad I watched it and would encourage others to give it a chance.Seeing the massive disparity between viewers ratings and critics ratings on Rotten Tomatoes, I can see why the massive gap. No virtual signaling. No laying on diversity with a trowel. Characters gender ignored. Characters sexual preferences ignored. No 'pass-the-bucket' messaging. About the most WOKE-free movie I've seen in ages.Nice to watch a new movie that doesn't make you want to heave.",

Admittedly I have nothing that I like either, but it's a forgettably fine film. In fact, I found it to be the quickest viewing experience of the year so far - the run time absolutely flew by for me.The cast are a bit up-and-down. Jared Leto has a few moments and overall I'm OK with him in the lead role, meanwhile Matt Smith is more miss than hit but again didn't annoy me or anything like that. Elsewhere, it was pleasant to see Jared Harris and Tyrese Gibson in smaller roles.The special effects, for the most part, are serviceable in my eyes. I think I also heard that people were questioning why the filmmakers didn't opt for prosthetics and went full blown CG for the faces - I found everything in that area to be fine, it would've been cooler if they mixed it up but if I hadn't heard anything about it I honestly would not have even noted it.There are some lame lines of dialogue, namely that hunger one, and the credit scenes don't leave any excitement or intrigue behind. Aside from that, I genuinely didn't dislike this. A quintessential 6/10 flick, for me. It is the weakest of the first three SSU films, granted.",

    "text": "Not sure why this movie got such low reviews. I read a lot of them and simply disagree with many of the hyper-criticisms. The movie is reasonably well paced, acted, and plotted. I think that when rating movies these days, there is a strange split between rating canon and rating the value/experience of the movie on its own merits. I tend toward the latter. As I have aged, I have found that unless I'm solely specifically looking for canon in my movies, I find that enjoying the movie mostly untethered to other expectations tends to lead to the best experience - this is such a movie.The focus is more on character experiences rather than straight up over-the-top continual fireball/lightning bolt duels that you get with most comic/superhero movies. The special effects were interesting even if totally CGI. For instance, one thing that I liked is the random bullet-time slow speed moments in some of Morbius' fights where the scene looks like something straight out of a comic book action freeze frame. I like the overall ambiance of it and other such creative flare moments that pop up. As for the plot, yah, you can probably tell where the movie's going before it gets there but somehow it still works out to an interesting explorative trip.Having said that, if you're a HARDCORE comic goer or follower of the specific comic Morbius looking for a movie with ULTRA gore; are completely focused on constant arguments about what is canon and whatnot with the character; are focused on the absolute cutting edge newest of the new special effects (ones that are less than like five minutes old); want 10 plot lines with 10 different random superheroes characters thrown in throughout; ...then this movie might not be for you. However, if you are just a regular movie-goer (or relaxed comic fan) that wants to see a good movie for the evening without unnecessary over the top undue complications and an interesting theme with a logical regular conscious flowing plot line of one main character, ...then definitely give this movie a shot. It's a good night out regardless of any light flaws it might have.",

Praise be to Morbius, and I can't wait to watch it for the 75th time. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83e\udd87",

Everything else is fine to me though. Given the character, basically a vampire (meaning just way too overtold origin story), it must be hard to make it original or exciting, I suppose.",

    "text": "Let me get this out the way,this film had the a certain issue which VENOM had when it dropped for me. Now...\nPros:\n*The PLOT was easy to follow straight to the point, you know exactly what Michael is doing & for what reason & why he does what he does, when things go wrong\n*Theme was just fine for me overall, though it might fall for some, in this department depends on the individual\n*Characters is both a pro & con for me, you have some who were enjoyable, some you might care less for. Michael, Martine & Emil were the ones I enjoyed more & wanted to see more of in this film\n*Attention to detail when it came to showing us his abilities was very interesting for me. The hearing, sonar, flight, speed in a manner I personally haven't seen before so that was refreshing. We already seen plenty of super strength.Cons:\n*Action \"Venom Effect\" as I call it, there are action scenes in the film lol some looked good once you got use to the speed trail effect during the lighter scenes,but some of the more darker ones \"Venom effect\" you could barely make out at times what is actually transpiring cause it's so dark.*Villain was just boring this is where the film was falling for me. Just wasn't a overall good villain. Motives you get, but overall Milo just wasn't it. Why not use BLACKOUT maybe or VIC SLAUGHTER who's just a ruthless vampire from Morbius own creation which I thought Milo was suppose sorta at 1st,but fell extremely short..since where diving into the more cosmic side now LILLITH would've been interesting character to use, but enough on that,decent start for a origin see it for yourself, only way to go from here is up.",

Because you will never get that, with any Marvel or DC Comics movie, so if it's that they are searching for I would just stop watching any of those movies. And even if this character isn't like the comic book does it really matter? I only want to be entertained and Morbius is certainly entertaining. Decent CGI's, good acting and a story that is easy to follow. I thought Jared Leto and Matt Smith did a good job playing their characters. If you're a fan of superhero movies, Marvel or DC Comics, you shouldn't pay too much attention to the low ratings this one gets because in my humble opinion it's unjustified.",

Focused on story. On a man fighting his illness, focused on helping others and then focused on fighting or rather utilizing something that got into him.Very simple scene setup. No extravaganza. Good acting. Nice story telling. Compared to over budget Avengers movies it was like a theater than a movie. And that is why I enjoyed a lot this simple good movie.Very good acting. Good actors. And story and problems were in main focus without creating some artificial villains.I enjoyed hero's struggling with his illness and then the unknown and getting new abilities. And scientific mind.Generally it a very good, simple and coherent story. With promising ending announcing continuation with Vulture.Good job.",

Matt Smith should have been the lead role. I want Al Madrigal in cinema!It was too dark. The visual effects were a poor spin on The Matrix with disorientating focus reminiscent of the worst Michael Bay styling.The story was wasn't very interesting. The vampires didn't even look as good as Buffy The Vampire Slayer.The first maybe ten minutes made a familiar but not unwelcome attempt to ground the transformation with sci-fi detailing but it farcically descended in to fantasy in a way that way really jarring. If it had the humor and fun of a usual Marvel outing maybe this would have been fine but with it's self serious tone it just came off as lazy.I really don't even think die hard Marvel and comic book fans would be in to this.It did make want to watch Blade though to take the taste away.",

Of course if you're a die hard comic book/Morbius fan then yeah maybe they messed up because it's hard to get comic book adaptations perfect on the big screen. Putting those few die hard fans aside, I thought the movie provided a good introduction to the character of Morbius. It had a good story of how Michael became the vampire blood draining monster and had good emotion throughout the movie. Especially the scenes with his childhood doctor and best friend Milo. Marvel fans nowadays get caught up in big cameos or surprise appearances, and yes this movie had one in the mid credit scenes, but it was just a fun film to introduce a new character onto the big screen for the first time. I for one am excited to see what they do with Morbius going forward.",

    "text": "This could have easily been a three hour movie and I wish it had been. While there are glimpses into Michael's past, they are not highly developed. In fact, I'd venture to say that Michael is post antidotal for 80% or more of the movie. While this direction allows for more action, it's less emotional and less exciting due to the lack of character development. There is no journey between any of main character's childhoods and career. It's more of a flashback per se. I would have liked to have seen more of the struggle in condition and in experimentation. How Michael arrived at his treatment is explained in seconds and is the only trial viewed. Something along the lines of I am Legend would have been nice. All of that aside, the visuals were phenomenal. The stage, costume, and locations were all satisfying. While some have criticized the special effects, the CGI is well executed; though, it isn't ground breaking as it's very similar to the style seen by Nightcrawler in the X-Men franchise or perhaps, Jumper. While the movie is action packed with a few intense moments, it does suffer from a bit of predictability. Overall, it's a decent film thats quite enjoyable for a Friday night flick. I would also say it flirts with an R rating, so don't let the PG13 rating scare you away too far.",

But... there were problems.First problem. The mutation made Jared Leto even uglier. This made it hard for me to watch the screen continuously.Second problem. The story was extremely predictable. There was this huge focus on charactever development for the first part of the movie (the part I was able to watch). And there was no emotional connection, partially due to the sound effect work, and partially due to being, well, uninteresting.Third problem. I tried to play with my phone for the rest of the film after becoming bored and kinda grossed out. But the video and sound editing were seemingly disruptive by design. I wasn't completely sure anymore, but the scenes seemed to cut into each other with the audio bleeding over from the next scene before the camera cuts.Fourth problem. The audio itself was absolutely gnarly. I didn't want to hear it. I'd rather listen to a dog eat pig vomit.As a result of these problems, I ended up not even listening to the rest of the film, preferring to play with my phone. I think I made it to minute 29.",

    "text": "* * *\nOverall #Morbius gives Halle Berry's Cat Woman - meets Venom: Let There Be Carnage - meets Nutty Professor (without the humor) - meets Splice - meets TwilightIs this a \"bad\" film? No. But it definitely built up regrettable excitement and expectations. Additionally, I found myself disappointed with the film's representation of the disabled community. There are blogs and research that suggests the worst thing you could do in a fantasy/hero movie is to have a character who's physical disability is \"fixed\" in order to take on powers and abilities.As I watched this movie, 2 things went through my mind:1. Why couldn't they make this the first Marvel Halloween-horror adjacent anti-hero film, taken a little more time in the brainstorm tank, and released this in October?2. Does every Marvel comic need to be a full feature length? This could've been a fantastic series.OTHER THOUGHTS:Highlights: Matt Smith actually gave one solid and engaging performance. I really enjoyed him. Additionally, shout out to the special and visual effects-Stunning! There must be a video game in the works! Or at least put Morbius in the next Injustice installment (LOL). I also loved the opening and ending credits colors and music. It just felt cool.Could've Been Better: The character development for Matt Smith's character lacked. His 0-100 shift made the issues of the story stand out for me. Additionally, the follow through of the themes could've been stronger with a more intentional Act One to guide the rest of the story.",

I must've because as a 56 year old female, I have a very, very low tolerance for most action and/or based-on-comic movies and I thought it was awesome. Acting was great across the board. Jared Leto was phenomenal as Morbius and Matt Smith, who I've always had a love/hate thing with was outstanding. I thought the script was solid. Do I wish for a bit more explanation, background, and details about a few things? Sure I do, but when don't I? I'm a tough sell, especially with these types of movies. Special effects (CGI) were great; it was an excellent decision for Jared to push hard for CGI over makeup. And it's even more impressive knowing that body doubles weren't used; Jared both gained muscle AND lost a crap ton of weight to look super sickly/frail. My husband and I both thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Can't wait to see what other things \"the few against the many\" can do. Bring it on!",

The list is now called Morbius and some other films you might like here and there. Certified Fresh on RT is now changed to 'Roughly 1/4 as good as Morbius'.Agatha Christie was asked what it was like to be named a Dame of the British Empire and she said, \"pretty nice, but I won't live long enough to see Morbius, so everything else pales beside that.\"James Hetfield was asked how he felt to walk out on stage in front of 1.3M fans.

I had to force myself to sit through this flat piece of cinema ... Its not awful, just another pinicle of mediocrity churned out by holly wood money men ... The Eternals lay they like a dead salmon, this lays there like a dead piranha ... It needed blood and violence with humour ... Its like Blade being castrated ...

It's a movie that felt like it was just checking the right boxes at the minimum while flying through a plot that was really just made to introduce the character and set them up for more movies. However, unlike most movies where you can get immersed into the story this one missed that magic for me. At points I got bored plain and simple but other points I was into it. The special effects in this movie carried it (and I usually am not a huge fan of heavy cgi) and the plot/acting dragged it down. It's mediocre compared to similar movies to say the least but it wasn't like some garbage movie as others would try to make you think. It's like. B- C+ kind of movie.",

That being said the film starts strong but then gets bogged down in the middle.Its very predictable as hero movies generally are, but I never really felt that invested in the character itself and his journey, unlike Venom or most non-Sony Marvel films. The ethical conflict never had enough depth, and lacked that moral dilemma for the character which would have suited this film perfectly.People who are into vampirism may enjoy it more than me as its not my jig, but it really doesn't offer anything new besides some cool new CGI, some dark shocking scenes and some half decent performances given the plot was a bit lacking.

But this time, let's have another bad villain (Milo played by Matt Smith), Make our own character a villain, and have a bunch of zombie looking vampires fly around the screen in a blur. Are you kidding me? Well I hope marvel executives are proud of themselves because look what happened..DC took a step forward with \"Joker\" and now \"The Batman\".. which was phenomenal. The last time marvel came out with something good besides avengers endgame was \"the punisher\". (A+). Unbelievable how they abandoned that project along with the defenders. They really had something going there. Check out Nick Cage, Daredevil or Jessica Jones fabulous series. Sorry Morbius... You're going in the wrong direction! GRADE D.",

    "text": "What do you get when you let Sony tell a Marvel story? Hopefully not Morbius! Because morbid is the least of its troubles! How can I compare it to other Superhero films? Let me count the ways!Firstly it has a jump-in-your-seat scary scene, it's a dark film, and does not project a shred of empathy towards the characters whom are shallow, empty representations of people. Sony is definitely not Marvel as they do not know how to tell a story that is attractive to the audience- not a note of comedy and always using an English actor/accent to play the villain! The action is blurred, and the scenes between are slow and boring! Personally, I'm glad it was a short torture to watch!All origin stories are drawn out and lack much action, but this story ups the bore, not gore! An unlikeable character that shows no sign of emotion unless pain is given abilities that are not fully categorised throughout the film. Blurry, colourful scenes are supposed to heighten our senses, but really distort them instead! His ears may itch or transform but we are left with quick cuts and unfinished potential as Jared jumps from one ability to the other.The only clue we are given that it inhabits the same universe as Venom is already in the trailer- and that's all we get! A superhero is supposed to put other's well being above his/her own, but Morbius is as self-centred as Ritchie Rich with no redeemable qualities I could find at all.The love interest, if you can call it that, is quasi inconsistent and feels totally unbelievable when it does spring up! The villain or antagonist is a cardboard cut out with nothing new to bring to the party! Hopefully the next instalment, if there is one, will develop the character and his abilities more understandably and stick to one genre. If it's horror- make it all horror- don't fall short like this film did, please!",

What I do know is that this flick was a fun, compelling superhero origin story that kept me entertained.Sure, it wasn't groundbreaking. It wasn't crammed with shared-universe tie-ins. And it certainly wasn't a masterpiece. But the acting was great, the CGI was dazzling, and the atmosphere was chilling in the best way.Jared Leto was a great fit for this role, and the character was fleshed out well (even if the supporting characters were a bit lacking in this department.)Bottom line: don't let the bad reviews fool you. My husband and I enjoyed this movie and give it a thumbs up.",

The chemistry between Leto and Smith was nice to see but I just wish their characters were more fleshed out as there is so much lacking in their development. The cinematography was really nice and the overall plot was predictable but not the worst I've seen on the other hand the cgi in this film is awful and completely stopped me from being able to fully submerge in the story. This film had some strong potential for a newcomer in the Sony cinematic franchise but just ultimate falls short. The other main issue is the writing; most characters just make stupid decisions such as the detectives and it's hard to watch whilst trying to suspend disbelief. It doesn't deserve the current rating of 4.6 as believe me I've seen much worse films but it just doesn't hold up compared to the other films in Sony's world.",

I can replace superhero with God & see something initiative.2- Superhero's fights based on some jealousy/envy feelings.. I can replace these with Qabil & Habil.3- Humans & Superhero both are fighting & afraid of death.I found some weaknesses: why Marvel show us how they are trying to find something that could be the bid. To let the superheros fight on. It lacks when we - as audience - notice.I found no point of redundancy of pinning the woman to stick on our heads as main character, not gone, awake!I found no point of romance scenes!! Maybe later which I never go to watch such low quality series that start with weak spark & zero build-up for the main characters or even.One last good thing: Superhero is curse. It was so good to be mentioned.One last bad thing: why superhero movies keep showing up the police as weak as we know, I think it is pointless for big segment of audience like the teenagers for example! We need to get rid of such not needed fights and show-off.",

But at times this film feels a little weak in aspects compared to the other films we've had some characters were good while some were bad. The Tension of the transformation of Morbius is so amazing and I'll say all the action sequences with Morbius on his own were amazing but the fights between him and the villian were very wonky and at times you couldn't see anything. Overall as it's own movie without any connections feels weird and plays as basically generic Vampire flic which could appeal to either audience but staying for credits expands this universe tremendously and while this isn't a spolier but vulture does show up and whats coming to this universe is going to be massive.",

Also I like Jared Leto but my God he's horrible in this, wtf is that script man??",

The movie starts well enough and set up a fun story, the last third of this movie is where the film falls flat with an abrupt ending and a terrible final battle. Morbius himself is an interesting enough character that I wouldn't mind seeing him pop up in later films, but as for this one it's pretty meh.",

Maybe the story could have been abit richer, fuller like Iron Man, Spiderman etc but it was a well spent 1hr 40min.Acting was on point esp from Michael (Jared) and Lucian.

    "text": "When it comes to comic book adaptations, and the Marvel Universe in particular, my 13-year-old son teaches me who's who in the superhero community, what their background stories are, and how the characters link together over different movies/franchises. When I want to teach my 13-year-old son about genuine cinematic landmarks and cult classics, well... he isn't interested.So, if I understood Junior correctly, Morbius is a supportive character/occasional villain in the Spider-Man comics, but - like Venom and Joker - he received his very own spin-off movie simply because comic book adaptations are hugely popular and profitable. In case of \"Morbius\", it's clearly just to make easy money because the plot is derivative and unoriginal. Since birth, Michael Morbius suffers from a rare but serious blood disease, and he spends his entire youth in a specialized hospital with, as his only friends, companion-in-suffering Milo and Dr. Emil Nicholas. But Michael is also a brilliant and naturally born gifted biochemist and he starts working on unorthodox cures for himself and Milo. He reaches an astounding breakthrough when he mixes his own blood with the DNA of bats, but - surprise - the treatment has monstrous side-effects.I don't want to sound too skeptical, because my son enjoyed it very much, and probably millions of Marvel/comic book movie fanatics with him, but \"Morbius\" only stands out in pure nothingness. The story is predictable and flat, the characters are bland, the digital effects are pitiable, and the amount of bloodshed/violence is kept to a miserable minimum to make sure a PG-13 rating could be obtained. Sorry, that sounded quite skeptical after all.",

Whelp, majority rules - this SUCKED.This movie was completely and utterly unfinished. There were many spots where things just abruptly happened to the point where the character is suddenly out of character. \"Oh! I guess *he's* a bad guy now\" or \"So the justice system works in seconds and not months to years?\"Another Dr. Who's strange is so desperate to cure his and his blood-brother's blood disease, he resorts to making himself an instant enemy of Blade. And then stuff happens, most of what you'd expect and many WTH moments.This reminded me a lot of Hancock and Fant4stic Four (2015) whereas the first half is like \"eh, it's not as bas as everyone says it is\" and the second...oh, this movie needs an exorcism. Especially the end and end credit scenes.I think I liked Jared Leto in one or two movies, namely Dallas Buyers Club. But ever since then, I cannot stand him. He reminds me a lot of Adrien Brody. They both seem so incredibly arrogant, pretentious and completely unapproachable.Now, that all said, he wasn't terrible here. Just..boring. He looked SOO bored. Matt Smith seemed to be the only one in the movie who looked like he was having fun. Despite all that HORRRIBLE CGI they splashed on him.Don't even get me started on the terrible CGI. It already looked terrible in the trailers and I always had hope they'd clean it up before the movie's release. Nope. And worse, these people had TWO YEARS since the first trailer dropped. They had plenty of time to Sonic the Hedgehog this bad baby up.There's a scene in the trailer and movie with the \"good\" doctor flying. Well, here, he'll have PLENTY of large enough plot holes to soar right through.***Final Thoughts: These desperate attempts and films of Sony to hang onto the Spidey-verse are so bad. I'm not sure which is worse: Venom 1-2, this or The Amazing Spider-Man 1-2. Sony, just stop. PLEASE STOP.(Oh, and for those wondering what the correct answer is, it's: The Amazing Spider-Man. Not just the worst Spider-Man media anything, it's one of the worst superhero movies ever made.)",

The beginning was pretty solid, but it dropped for the rest of the movie. The middle has absolutely nothing happening in it, and the climax was a confusing battle. The fight scene in the climax was very confusing due to not knowing what is going on, just a bunch of rubble flying around on the screen. Overall, this is a terrible movie, though it had potential, it flopped after the first 20-30 minutes.",

Morbius is a film I enjoyed quite a lot and think maintains the spirit of the '90s comic books I grew up reading. I was thoroughly entertained. That's not the consensus, and that's OK.And to the people eating the movie so negatively without even being aware of the source material and assuming that this is supposed to just be a random vampire flick I can see why you don't understand. Morbius is more then just a vampire. If you were to atleast read a summary of the morbius comics I bet you would change ur reviews.",

    "text": "This is a movie that I was intrigued by. I knew of this character from the Marvel comics. This would have been when I was in elementary school when I was collecting Spider-Man ones. If memory serves, he would be facing off against a villain named Kane and Morbius made an appearance. I completely forgot about this until I saw a bit of the trailer for this movie. It did interest me, knowing that we were getting a comic book movie that was shifting into the horror genre. The synopsis then for this movie is biochemist Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) tries to cure himself of a rare blood disease, but he inadvertently infects himself with a form of vampirism instead.For this movie, we start in South America. I believe it is Costa Rica. The area had the Spanish name for death, but since I saw this in the theater, I didn't write it down. We get to meet our doctor here of Morbius as he is leading a team. He has this high-tech trap and he is trying to capture a special type of bat to this area. We learn these are ones can kill larger animals. I like that we are introduced here that Morbius has a physical ailment that he needs to walk with crutches.We then shift 25 years into the past. We are in a hospital in Greece. Michael is a boy. The doctor that is trying to help him is Emil Nicholas (Jared Harris). Another boy is brought in and Michael goes about calling him Milo, due to them not staying there long. His real name is Loxias Crown. The two of them hit it off. They both have a genetic disorder that causes them to need what the young Michael calls an 'oil change' three times a day. We also see that Michael is brilliant as he saves Milo's life, much to the amazement of Dr. Nicholas.In the present, Morbius is a brilliant biochemist. He won an award for his research in Sweden. We also see that he doesn't care about things like this though, to the point where he offends them. Working with him at a special hospital that also houses his laboratory is Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona). She reveals that she knows his password and found his research. It is not only unethical, but illegal. He is using bat DNA to try to fix his own genetics. His experiment works in a lab mouse, so he is going to use it on himself.I should also point out here that Milo has moved to New York City as well. The two of them spend time together where Dr. Nicholas is helping him. Milo is helping to fund Morbius' experiments in hopes he can save them both.Things then take a turn when the experiment works. There is a side effect that turns Morbius into a vampire. He has bat like features when he is the creature. Morbius contains his hunger with a synthetic blood he created. The problem is that the more he uses it, the less it staves off the hunger. He is against the clock. There is another complication when Milo gets his hands on this experiment as well. Milo doesn't have the same self-control that his friend does. Two federal agents are also on to them, Simon Stroud (Tyrese Gibson) and Rodriguez (Al Madrigal). This puts the city at risk as Morbius tries to save himself and his friend before it is too late.That is where I'm going to leave my recap here. I might have spoiled something here if you aren't familiar with Morbius and his foes. What I will say is that the movie reveals this early on. I don't think it ruins the movie knowing this information either. When I was watching this, I knew that having Smith in this role of Milo that he would be important. Since I'm not up on the lore of Morbius, I wasn't sure who his villain would be. One of the bright spots is what the movie does with the emotional aspect for that. It isn't anything new though, especially for these types of movies. I am forgiving and can go with it as this is a common concept for comic book adaptations.For the positives, I was glad to see another try doing a comic book adaptation in the horror vein. Morbius is a vampire. From what I remember, he's an anti-hero as well. I didn't delve too much into him and I still don't know a lot. We are getting an origin story here for the most part. He can't control his abilities or his thirst. This is strategic that the first people he attacks are shady characters. I did like what they do with this experiment. They go out into international waters on a vessel. He also has mercenaries who aren't the nicest people protecting him. Using characters like this here is strategic as we don't like or connect with them.I did want to shift slightly as the ship they're on is called Murnau. This is a reference to F. W. Murnau who directed the vampire film, Nosferatu. Without even realizing this, I wore my shirt from this classic. If I do have a negative though with all of this, they are tame with the horror elements. Part of this is going for that PG-13 rating. I'm not going to complain too much, but they could have gone darker.Since I've already brought up negatives, that is where I'll go next. I'm not sure what their plan is with this movie. The villain of Morbius and how that plays out feels like it should be a sequel. I'm sure they didn't know if this would do well and from what I'm hearing, this movie isn't, so I'm not sure if we will get this character back. It almost feels like this movie should have had Morbius being more of anti-hero. Have the authorities coming after him and focus on him as a character. The villain we have here feels forced and bit a rushed.I won't go into details about this, but I also don't necessarily like that they are pushing this into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I can't blame them. There is so much money there. I don't mind the idea of Morbius being a part of it. What I will go back to though is that maybe give him a movie where we truly get to learn about him. I've heard rumors that Marvel is going to do their own Blade movie. I would have liked to see them go into a darker side of the MCU first before bringing him in with other super-heroes or villains. MCU is all about the long game and this being in conjunction with them just feels like Columbia is forcing to get that payday.That should be enough for the story so I'll go over to the acting. I thought our four leads are solid. Leto brings a bit of snark to Morbius that I appreciate it. If anything, we get that in the beginning and it goes away from it as the movie progresses. I wanted more of him personally. Smith is good as Milo. I like the change in his character as well. We feel it there from the beginning, he just needs the strength. Arjona is good as the voice of reason for Morbius. He ignores though, of course. I liked Harris, but he's another one that I wanted more of. He is such a solid actor. Gibson is fine along with Madrigal. It is interesting that the former isn't playing the comedic role where his counterpart is. Different from what I'm used to for sure. Other than that, the rest of the cast was fine for rounding this out for what was needed.This will then take me to the effects, cinematography and the soundtrack. For the former, this is a CGI fest. I like the look of Morbius. His vampire is bat-like. There are also vibes of Nosferatu there. I would have liked a bit more practical effects as this all seemed to be CGI. The use of the bat sonar stuff is fine. Again, this was done with computers. I get why, but I don't love it overall. The cinematography was also fine. They go a bit too far with some of it, but they're also doing it to showcase Morbius' abilities. Other than that, the soundtrack fit the movie for what was needed.In conclusion here, this is a movie that I came in with low expectations. Trying to combine horror elements with a comic book film interests me, but I still have not seen one that does it well since something like Blade 2. Morbius is an interesting character so that does keep me invested a bit. The acting here is solid enough, but I wanted more of Leto and Harris. Doing a bit more with practical effects would help, but they use more CGI. The cinematography left a bit to be desired. This feels more like they're doing an origin story for Batman; I did want to say that. Despite my expectations, this movie was disappointing. I'd say this is over average. It is serviceable, but they could do more.My Rating: 6 out of 10.",

I still don't understand how the beginning scene ties to the rest of the movie. If you can hold on for a bit, the movie can be entertaining. Some said it was worse than Venom. I strongly disagree. The CGI could have been better. I agree with other reviewers that an R rating is more appropriate for this type of movie.",

    "text": "I was expecting a turd based on reviews and box office numbers I heard in the news, but it really isn't bad at all for a comic book film. I felt this movie would have benefitted greatly if the producers targeted an R-rating and added some blood and gore. But between the studio bean counters looking for maximum revenue of a PG rated film and an elitist communities of comic book gatekeepers ready to condemn a film that doesn't fit their pedantic canon, these films have a hard time.The core of the story isn't unique once you strip away the marvel universe. It has some of its basis in the Old Testament. Even the names of the two main characters indicate as such. Dr. Michael Morbius like Michael the Archangel and Milo/Lucien like Lucifer battle each other, one good and the other bad.Unlike the biblical stories, this story doesn't really show why Lucien became evil with his new power. We don't see what made him go to the dark side. Both were loved and taken care for by Dr. Emil Nicholas. Both men were adopted brothers. So the crucial part missing with this film is what caused the separation? In this film, both men actually save each other's lives at different points in the film. So what broke that brotherly bond to cause Milo/Lucien go astray?The other part that bugged me is why were there mercenary thugs on the ship where Morbius was working with Martine? Who paid those guys to be on that ship and why were they concerned with what Morbius and Martine were doing? See, that wasn't explained either.The acting performances by all of the actors are great. Hey, these Brits know their art and they are all wonderful actors. Jared Leto pulled his weight too. The special effects were good too, although I've seen some of these effects before like the X-Men Nightcrawler played by Alan Cumming.The film isn't a turd. I really think they should have aimed for that R-rating and patched up the plot holes with regards to Lucien's descend into murder and evil. I just think two men who grew up as two boys together would try to save each other first before going nuclear on each other.This character also begs what would happen if Morbius and Blade crossed paths. If Marvel rebooted Blade and then made a film with Morbius and Blade, that would be a film worth watching.",

Contrary to popular beliefs, I found it to be somewhat decent, neither great nor terrible. Perhaps it is because I had gone in with little to no expectations. Almost everyone despised it, showing their discontent with Sony for whatever they had brought to the table. While I do understand why they might be so upset, I still believe Morbius got an unfair amount of harsh criticism and in some cases for no significant reasons.Now don't get the wrong idea, I'm not here to play the devil's advocate; matter of fact, I too feel the inconsistencies of the writing to be bothersome. Especially, in terms of the overall characterization. That friendship between Michael and Milo was an indispensable piece of the plot, as the entire story is kind of based on that exact dynamic. While it is also true that they both had their fair share of screentime to demonstrate their newly gained powers (I just loved it whenever Morbius uses 'Echolocation') but these same characters, never got the chance to flourish as their normal selves, as human beings; and for a comic book movie, that is a major drawback I reckon.The same goes for the characters of Martine Bancroft and Dr. Nicholas as well. I don't know how much importance they hold in the actual stories as I haven't read the comics nor do I have substantial knowledge about the Lore or about any of these characters for that matter, but one thing is for certain, these two characters shared the same fate as our primary figures.Efficient yet unmemorable!",

    "text": "\"It's not as bad as you heard\", is certainly the very definition of damning something with faint praise, but that is exactly the right thing to say about the 2022 Sony Comic Book Film Adaptation of MORBIUS.Starring Jared Leto, MORBIUS follows the origin story - and first adventure - of Spiderman villain Morbius who, inexplicably, becomes the hero in this story.While, ultimately, not a good film, there are some good things happening here, so let's begin there.The lead performance by Jared Leto as Dr. Michael Morbius is - very surprisingly - somewhat grounded in reality. Leto is not one to be subtle in his character choices (see HOUSE OF GUCCI) but in this one, he is (somewhat) reserved. It would have been easy for Leto to go over the top with this character, but he wisely chooses the opposite route...and it works. The always watchable Jared Harris (CHERNOBYL) is on-board in the \"mentor\" role while Tyrese Gibson and Al Madrigal bring some humor to the proceedings as \"Agents\" who are chasing after Morbius. The rest of the cast are benign - neither adding nor detracting from the proceedings - with the exception of Matt Smith (LAST NIGHT IN SOHO) who's character is so badly written that he flounders under the weight of the absurdity of what his character is tasked with.Trying to overcome the ridiculousness of the story is the Direction by Daniel Espinosa (the Denzel Washington action flick SAFE HOUSE). He moves the action along quickly, never really lingering on the absurdities of the events going on (and there are PLENTY of absurdities to avoid - more on that later) and Espinosa actually has an artistic vision of what he wanted to accomplish visually in this comic-book film, freezing many frames when the picture on the screen looked like a page from a graphic novel. It's a smart choice for a film that can only be described as dumb.And dumb this film is. I kept feeling any sense of common sense and reality slip away as this film - written by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless - quickly devolved into the absurd and ridiculous. One does have to suspend belief when watching Comic Book films (how else are we going to believe that a man can turn into a human spider) but in this case, the suspension is mighty - it is one of the dumbest films ever made (in terms of plot and situations) and that is saying something. The makers of this film really stretch the term \"go with me here\" as Morbius is constantly chasing and evolving and being chased in the most absurd ways throughout this film with special effects that add to the absurdity of the proceedings. To be fair, this film never falls into the \"so bad it's good\" range, it hovers just above that line.The end credits scenes start to setup a \"Sinister Six\" Spiderman film, so there is some hope for this - it would be interesting to see Leto's Morbius team up with some other Spiderman villains (who's names would be a spoiler), provided the script is better. There's no way that it can be worse.MORBIUS is not a bad film - it just will insult your intelligence.Letter Grade: C4 Stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",

Also, when the movie ended, I felt that it needed more before its ending to fully complete the \"picture\" it wanted to deliver. So concerning the score, I give Morbius 6 out of 10.",

However, he accidentally infects himself with something far more sinister.Morbius is an unremarkable movie at its worst & a stupidly entertaining film, at its best. Director Daniel Espinosa has given us a satisfactory origin story. However, Morbius is not an iconic character like Venom or Spider-Man. The audience won't really care what happens to this character unless the movie is flawless, which this definitely isn't. Sony really needs to introduce a Spider-Man into their villain universe. Even next year's Kraven the Hunter(2023) movie, has to have Spidey. The drawback of Venom(2018) & Venom: Let There Be Carnage(2021) was the absence of the beloved wallcrawler. Since Tom Holland's Peter Parker/Spider-Man is in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Sony's Spider-Man Universe should bring back Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker/Spider-Man after the monstrous hit that was Spider-Man: No Way Home(2021). The action set pieces are just about passable. The visual effects are laugh-worthy. Not a big fan of Morbius' vampire face. The mid-credits scene teases a future that may or may not happen, which is very frustrating. The scene is also so forced & out of place. Jared Leto is great as Dr. Michael Morbius. Matt Smith is the star of the show as Milo. Smith gives us a scene-stealing & spectacular performance. You can tell that Matt Smith is having the time of his life. Smith's performance is the highlight of the film. Adria Arjona is superb as Martine Bancroft. Jared Harris is brilliant as Dr. Emil Nicholas. Tyrese Gibson & Al Madrigal are effective as Agent Simon Stroud & Agent Rodriguez, respectively. Morbius is not worth a watch. However, watch it if you have a lot of time to kill. Please do better, Sony!",

They made up for the difference with me buying a big popcorn!From the off, I'll concede that I'd heard how poor this was from the reviews and so went into it with low expectations, maybe it was the popcorn that was all I wanted. Anyhow, I've watched it and in truth I don't think it's as bad as critics are making it out to be but also not that great either. It's - meh!This is a vampire-esque movie where our antagonist is cursed with vampire superpowers and out to stop his old friend who goes too far wit the serum that caused their new condition. The problem for many is that Jared Leto has unfairly and wrongly become a whipping boy. I think he's a great actor, but is now lumbered with some of lesser rated roles (such as in Gucci and Suicide Squad) being held against him. Give him a break, he's actually good in this film, he's NOT the problem.For me the problem is that this is really should be a darker horror film but tones down and is a mish-mash to be more of a comic book film, and that tone takes away from what it could have been. Also Matt Smith as the antagonist hams it up, and despite him being British, I have no clue what his accent was all about! Really terrible!This film is a fine popcorn movie, but the negatives can't be dismissed. It will be fine for most as a one-off viewing but definitely not for little kids even though it is a Marvel movie! Give it a go for a one-off, just keep your mind open.",

Effects to captivate the audience. The background sound effects are decent for a film of this type and the photography is too. The actors in the film are just about okay. I didn't find an actor I liked in this movie - too many stereotypes.The film concerns a boy with a terminal blood illness who grows up to become a research scientist in order to find a cure for his illness. However the cure he discovers has a horrifying and irreversible side-effect.The movie is somewhat similar to the cartoon episode/comic book character. Like many movies of this type, this one will get a sequel film. The movie has a very boring plot and it is directed badly. The script could have been better if the director had the good sense to change it. The special effects in the movie are nothing short of ridiculous and many in the audience are sure to guffaw.Overall I would call this movie a bitter disappointment and would only recommend this movie to diehard fans of Spiderman, Blade and Morbius.",

What at first appears to be a radical cure reveals itself to be potentially more dangerous.\"How far are we allowed to fix something that's broken?\" I think I found the cure for those that hated this movie...watch Love and Thunder first and you may appreciate it more. I actually liked parts of this and I'll look forward to seeing Morbius in future non-solo films. I had issues with the pace and humor of the film and its following of the comic mainly stems from easter eggs in the film; which you need to watch the blu-ray to see. This was not a bad watch overall, but I think it's my lowest score of the MCU films.4K: 8.2\nHDR=9 Audio=9 Bass=9 Bright=6 Speech=8The transfer on this is good but not great. It was really dark in parts and that made me want to put the blu-ray in. The sound and picture quality are solid, though...very little blur and good enough bass.

I had low expectations, and I got just what I expected.I'm only sorry for the actors since there is some acting talent in this. Even the director did good films in the past, like Life, which was a decent alien space horror.I think I know what went wrong, it takes only four letters, but I'm not going to write it cause the review won't go through.Final verdict: waste of time, money, and talent. As expected. The two mid-credit scenes made to get me excited did absolutely nothing.Thanks, I'll pass.",

    "text": "Entertaining and very atmospheric, Morbius manages to serve up yet another helping of campy superhero indulgence despite many little flaws. I'll start off with the problems I had with this film- that mainly being its blatant editing and CGI. I know many people say this about a lot of superhero films, but coming from a horror lovers perspective- as well as fitting the atmospheric and tone Life director Daniel Espinosa seemed to pair within it- this movie really should have been rated R. It feels like Sony really did censor and edit this one as much as they could have, with the blood and violence being as limited as possible. It takes away from the experience as a whole, one moment in particular where a man acts like his throat is cut open but there is LITERALLY NOTHING THERE. Unsurprisingly, as with the case with a lot of films like this, the CGI can be a bit overused at times. For the most part I liked the look of vampire blood hungry Morbius taken on by Jared Leto- but other similar CGI and at times that CGI itself can feel a bit too ugly and forced for comfort. The fight scenes towards the end in particular are also overdone with CGI, and I just really wish Sony would have let the people working on this film give some life to the project instead of worrying about its box office gross. I know i've complained a lot so far, but in terms of a film- I oddly did enjoy this one for the most part. Sure it's messy, Matt Smith's character is a bit over the top and it has some formulaic moments- but it is a very entertaining film. Leto and Arjona give their all to their performances and it has a lot of cool ideas and concepts that are interesting to see fleshed out on screen- particularly with Morbius in particular as he begins to learn how to control himself. There's a lot of humanity hidden beneath the surface in this film though, even with some formulaic moments, there's a lot of depth and heart put into the titular character and it really allows you to empathize both with the film's story as well as Leto on screen. In the end, I enjoyed Morbius- it is far from perfect but it was a solid superhero endeavor and I'm curious to see what they may do with this character next.",

The plot and effects were subpar, but I still found enjoyment in the world the movie takes place in and the drive morbius has for finding a cure to his disease. Despite being a marvel villain origin movie, it lacks the feel of one. \"Morbius\" is more of a light take on the thriller genre. I feel that \"Morbius\" needed a better sense of direction or purpose as it could be all over the place at times. I feel the movie came to a quick conclusion not letting many events develop into what could've been. Overall seeing this movie was a decent experience, but not a memorable one. I didn't feel any sort of attachment towards any of the characters as I don't think they had a very strong presence or importance. \"Morbius\" is not a movie I would necessarily recommend to anyone that isn't interested in the movie.Concept: 4/5\nPerformance: 3/5\nPlot: 2/5\nWriting: 3/5\nLogic: 3/5\nPacing: 2/5\nVisuals: 3/5\nSound: 4/5\nFX: 2/5\nEnjoyment: 3/5Overall: 29/50 or 58% positive.",

    "text": "\"Morbius\" isn't an awful film - it's just one that feels like it should've been released in 2004. And in fact, if you told me that this movie was actually filmed in 2004 and was delayed 18 years, finally being released in 2022, I'd believe you. In every way, \"Morbius\" is unremarkable; after watching, my basic thought process was: \"Well, that was certainly a movie.\" If \"standard and generic superhero film\" had a definition, \"Morbius\" would be it. This is just a flat, emotionless, corporate produced product that has only one thing in mind: the almighty dollar. The thing is, it wasn't unentertaining!While \"Morbius\" is forgettable in almost every way, it can serve as a quick, if unfulfilling, cinematic adventure. Yes, this movie is sanitized in order to maintain a PG-13 rating; yes, you can sense the studio meddling that results in a choppy, borderline incomprehensible plot; and yes, you better believe that the direction is as safe and sterile as grandma's home cooking. But if you put that aside (and drink copious amounts of alcohol before and during this cinematic experience), there is some fun to be had here.Jared Leto is actually great in the role of Michael Morbius; where I find him to be a great actor who is constantly overacting, in here he is quite restrained. While I have no idea why he decided to play a vampire antihero as restrained as he did, I must say I appreciated it simply because I found it unexpected. Did anyone overact in this movie? Oh, you better believe it! Matt Smith's Milo chews up the scenery, spits it out, and gnaws on it again in an unrestrained performance, complete with a minute long dance sequence. It's just so ridiculous, but it's a lot of fun.\"Morbius,\" of course, has some vampire action in it - you know, something for the kids. And when I say for the kids, I mean that literally - \"Morbius\" is the most bloodless vampire movie you've ever seen, but it's not all bad. The action is sterile, but it's fun to look at with its distinct visual flair that only Daniel Espinosa could bring to the table (that's just a joke - literally any other director could've filmed these action scenes, but with that said, they were still cool to watch). There's slicing, dicing, and sucking (get your head out of the gutter, pervert), but all of it is without the slightest hint of blood or gore. Is that disappointing? Of course. But does it ruin the action scenes? Not at all.Okay - I don't want to write anymore! So I'll end by saying that \"Morbius\" is the most ehhh superhero movie I've ever seen. There's nothing remarkable about it, but there's also nothing overly negative in it. Everything about this film is supremely generic, but it is also very watchable. If you have 90 minutes to kill and are in the mood to watch some vampire violence, you could do a whole lot worse.",

    "text": "If you looking for any old entertainment, you can find some here but otherwise it's a bottom of the barrel superhero film and an even worse Vampire movie \ud83d\ude29There are many issue but one of the most potent is the super fast pacing. Things happen so quickly that you don't have any time to take it in and understand what is happening nor do you develop any feelings for the characters. This doesn't even include the 25 year jump that is made at the start of the film.In keeping with the fast pacing, many things are unexplained or they happen off screen meaning that you have use your imagination to fill in the blanks and try to make sense of what is going on.The story is basic and predictable yet it still relies on several coincidences and as a result it doesn't feel earned.You never really get to understand the motivations of the characters. The Villain nor the romance are particularly convincing, largely down to a lack of plot and sufficient explanation. The facial CGI is poor though some of the action scenes had potential with fight scenes reminding of Nightcrawler in the X-Men which was cool.",

    "text": "Here is another blunder from Sony who continues to massacre Marvel characters for a shot of relevance. Morbius is so badly acted, that the absence of character development feels like a treat, just to unsee Jared Leto and Tyrese Gibson's bland scenes and dumb expressions. Story-wise, there were zero points to peak curiosity nor intrigue. Writers takes the fall for a very basic and formulaic plot that leaves one bored and blank faced. Further worsened by a forsaken & uninspired script, the film is further rendered without substance. Heres a line with Leto referring to bats: \"They would tear anyone else apart, but they welcomed me, like a brother\". What the actual Freak.For superhero films however, weak storylines and forgettable characters can rather be forgivable through jaw dropping action sequences. Unfortunately, Morbius fails miserably, to deliver here as well. Visually, the film holds the title of most unimpressive scenes to date. The action was uninspired and the effects were messy, juggling between and the use of slow-mo and blurring speed that fails to excite. Also, Morbius' echolocation abilities was overused & made over complex, to the point of annoyance.Unfortunately, the entire Morbius experience was laughable. It is a pathetic attempt to introduce a new storyline for the sake of expanding Sony's Spiderman Universe. Sony needs to start caring about reviews otherwise, STOP and let Marvel do its thing.",

But then the reviews were in and I had to see it for myself, and I was honestly let down it wasn't worse to be honest. Don't get me wrong, it's not good but it's not \"so bad it's good.\"There actually were objectively good things about this made me feel like people were just being too harsh on the movie at first. Jared Leto was honestly pretty good in the role of Michael Morbius. Not ground breaking, but if this movie was a lot better he would fit right in. A lot of the characters were actually somewhat interesting to follow and the science was honestly kind of fascinating at times. Also some of the cinematography was cool to look at, and some shots stick out to me as legitimately solidBut then the movie kept going....and what else can I say? The cgi was unforgivable, the story got bland and boring, a lot of the dialogue is pretty stupid, and the action starts out decent but slowly declines as the movie progresses. You can even tel a lot of what they probably wanted to show was dulled down because it needed to be PG-13, which venom also suffered from but this was even worse. You can even see Morbius slash an enemy in the neck, and you hear the sound effects of blood spewing but their neck is pretty much bone dryThere's also one scene specifically I thought was REALLY stupid, and it was the exact moment I shifted from \"This movie isn't THAT bad at all\" to \"Ok no, this movie is kinda garbage.\" Then the movie goes from stupid, to boring, back to stupid, and finishes extremely anti climactically. I went from probably being able to defend this movie to wishing I spent my money watching The Batman againSpeaking of Batman, yeah there's so many things straight up stolen from other movies! There's a shot straight out of both Batman Begins and the usual suspects. Want something to look forward to, try to spot them when you see itSo in the end, I expected much worse than what I saw, but it would be a disservice to call this movie even passable. Fine moments here and there, but select enjoyable elements while everything else is making the movie unbearable does not a good movie make. And normally I close out my reviews working in a line from either the trailer or the movie (For example I closed out my review of The Batman with \"I thought Uncharted would be my favorite movie of 2022, but the truth was unmasked in front of me,\") but honestly I got nothing. This movie was so forgettable I can't even conjure up a single memorable line other than \"I am Venom.\" Whatever, this movie's bad.",

I'd like to see where the story and characters lead. I think Sony does a great job making their Marvel movies feel like their own. Morbius feels and looks like a Morbius movie. The screen is filled bold clear coloration which is unique to itself. It would be a shame to not develop another installment with the list of Sony marvel characters. Morbius is in the world of Venom and the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man, I'm just saying. The lineup looks good to me. Trolls are the dredge of society.",

I don't need my narrative spoon fed, and dialogue that echoes the action is boring. The special effects were good, but I was sorry to see A listers like Matt Smith and Mr. Leto add this mess to their portfolios. No problem with the acting, just the script.Mostly I think Morbius will become a cult fav for Leto fans. It's so predictable and superficial I see no other value.",

    "text": "It is very, very hard to understand. The producers spend millions upon millions of dollars. They are businesspersons. They are not visionaries. They are not artists. They are investors who hedge bets based on the advice from people with extensive experience and doctorates-entire thinktanks that are paid millions of dollars to make sure that the investors are taking the smallest, most negligible risk possible. How then and why do massive failures happen? Let us think of Kevin Costner. Just because he pulled Dances with Wolves out of his puckering arsehole, everyone was absolutely convinced that Water World, Wyatt Earp, and The Postman would be the next greatest, best, and biggest money-making movie ever. I cannot help to wonder, after these three, if they had made one more. Fields of Dream Corn, for example. I never thought it would happen again. But then they did it. They created Morphius, a film that hit all the right categories but did not realize that whole is always more than the sum of the parts. There is no problem with the acting. There is no problem with the cinematography. There is no problem with the special effects. There is no problem with the basic storyline. The directing is above average and more than enough gets the job done. The producers smiled at themselves and congratulated the thinktank for doing such a superb and supremely awesome job, and I am sure they salivated as they confidently waited for their project to pay off. But the movie was horrible, and it was the one of the greatest failures in cinematic history. Why? It was because the machine, and the cogs that make up the machine, had not heart, for this is who they are, and like Morphius's nemesis in the movie, who they have become.",

What I enjoyed about Morbius is its pacing. Sure it could of added another 30 minutes of boring pointless dialogue in an effort to do this. But that's not necessary. It generally skips over the why and moves the plot along. Its action sequences look good. It could of done a better job of utilizing Vampire tropes but I understand it's restricted by its parental rating to maximize putting butts in seats. I would have preferred more blood and supernatural realistic violence. But it wasn't trying to be a horror movie unfortunately. So no it's not going to win any awards for the best SH movie of all time but it accomplishes the goal of introducing Doctor Michael Morbius into Sony's Spider-Verse.",

The story is kinda meh, the special effects are reaaaaally overdone and poor. You can barely tell whats happening during fight scenes because everything is just blurry CGI quick-cuts with the occasional slow-mo shot.I really feel bad for jared leto, who will now have been screwed on both sides of the comic book world (dc with the joker and now marvel with morbius) and through no fault of his own. He makes a good effort with the morbius character and hes obviously a decent actor who deserves a better writer director for these sorts of movies.At this point sony should just sell the remainder of their rights to marvel property and let more talented people who actually care about the source material do the work.",

Together with his partner, Milo (Matt Smith) and fellow doctor, Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona), they will attempt to cure his ailment by combining human DNA with that of a vampire bat.Even though this film is made in association with Marvel, it is not in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which means don't expect to see Thor or Captain America anytime soon. Morbius does, however, have some callbacks to other Sony-owned Marvel films, including Venom and Spider-Man.Fairly standard Marvel fare otherwise. Direction and script are what you would expect from these films. The special effects are really neat as well, but - unlike that of 'Blade' (1998) - features no graphic blood sequences and, instead, focuses on the blurry bullet-time speed of the characters' movements.Worth a once over, especially if this is going to be part of a grander scheme of films.",

He has one particularly memorable scene which I'm not sure is brilliant or laughable.A lot of the aspects of Morbius under deliver, particularly in there not being enough meat on the bones of the romance story.Morbius does succeed in setting the character up for further movies and it isn't so disappointing that I would avoid a sequel.Of course the mid credit scenes and linked universes are interesting although the casual multi verse mixing does need to be handled delicately as it does have the potential to undermine previous stories.",

Everything the mcu got right about building their universe, Sony seem hellbent on unpickingClearly building towards a SS showdown with Spider-Man but the question is which spiderman ?Not likely Holland as vulture has fought and lost to him and having been pulled to a different universe it leaves Andrew or tobey and I think likely Andrew sue to Tobeys age and the fan clamour for an Amazing Spider-Man 3So although this film had its flaws it could set up something spectacularI just hope Sony don't mess it upNot without faults but not as bad as made out to be.",

Anyway I fell asleep in the last 20 minutes and missed the whole climax of the movie but I could have guessed what happened it was that predictable so no big deal. The post credit scene saved the movie, although a little confusing.. fits the theme though! If you liked Twilight or \"What Is It Like To Be a Bat?\" by Nagel you'll enjoy this slightly more.",

I feel like every actor and actress did a really great job with their parts and the screen time that was available to them.The film also benefits from a Marvel budget and therefore has great special effects, in fact the special effects for Morbius and the movement and vampire parts are absolutely incredible.The story itself while not brilliant or something out of legend is not bad either. It sets up the characters and movie pretty well. For someone like me whose first time it was learning about the character Morbius I didn't feel stranded or anything, instead I was introduced slowly to the character.All in all a good origin movie for Morbius and sets him up to take part in the wider Marvel Cinematic Universe. Though the ending was a bit confusing and left me trying to understand the post credit scenes.A solid 7/10 from me for a decent origin movie, could have been better but was pretty good as it was. Would recommend watching it if you're a Marvel/Superhero-villain movie fan or just want to see the origin of one Dr, Michael Morbius!",

    "text": "I have to admit that reading reviews before watching this film really clouded my judgment. This is not to say this movie was good, but it is also not to say it was horrible.Let me point out the good because you have all heard the bad by now.I felt like I was watching a video game. The action scenes display how multiple senses are being used; the colors for visuals, the cinematic sounds vibrated the theater for feel, and the immersive sounds all intertwine whenever there is a fight. The film highlights action shots that resemble most video game cut scenes that pride themselves on close combat.The cosmetics weren't bad yall lol you saw the previews. We know how this man was gonna look. From sicko to health, I believe the film did an excellent job of making Morbius look hideous and ridiculous; okay, maybe I'm getting carried away. The ending credit scenes may not be on point with your super marvel fan or the comics, but this is the Marvel cinematic universe; none of these films will resemble the comics bar for bar word for word; shoutout to Soulja Boy. So I'm actually intrigued by this multiverse setup.Now the questionable, the film doesn't set up the antihero too well. Although Moribus is a dark character, I wasn't convinced by his murderous side, nor was I convinced of his heroic side. Was there a heroic side?Two points to note are the similarities to other superhero films.1. When iron man learns how to maneuver, his suit looks much similar to Moribus figuring himself out in the lab with less trial and error.2. Morbius's antagonist or villain is another Moribus, which resembles the first installment of 'Venom' ( they used a corny venom joke).This takes away from the authenticity; I understand this is an origin story. Unfortunately, with this new wave for Marvel characters in the cinematic universe/Sony included, no one truly knows these characters, so origin stories are hit or miss. Just think how confused people were with 'Eternals'.The bad... there are no vital elements other than action scenes in this film. The film flirts with thrill and horror, but it is clear that it is out of its lane. No genuine love interest or appeal to emotions.It is just a melodic approach to telling a dark story with the light still on. This is not Motel 6.I understand how this can be a disappointment, especially with the delays. I did doze off toward the end, especially with a mediocre finish.Verdict: Moribus seems rushed but ultimately serves as the guinea pig for marvel stepping outside its lane. Is the movie bad? If you consider all the hype and elements outside that doesn't meet marvels standards, then yes. Is it worth the watch? Not in theaters, but I would always suggest you watch these films and shows to know what's happening, even if it is confusing and not up to par with your usual standards.",

It won't be a waste of your money or time as long as you keep your expectations in check. If that is what you want, stop reading now.At worse, it's a poorly written, edited, and directed movie. Some of filmmaking mistakes are consistent with what you'd get from college students. The movie was rushed, the dialog idiotic at times, the scene continuity editing amateurish. The main star is neither a convincing protagonist or antagonist. The movie seemed disjointed. The construction of the characters and their motivations was inept.I could go on, but I assume if you're still reading, you get the hint.5/10 - nice eye candy action scenes, but not much more.",

Leto killed it, Matt smith was excellent & the cinematography was very very good.It has horror movie vibes but maintains comic book reminiscence by limiting jump scares & fully exposing us to \"the monster\" from very early in the movie.We have a lovable character utterly distraught by his haunting vampire alter ego & Leto captures this perfectly!!The one thing I really can't say enough about is that normally with \"scary monster\" movies, the reveal is the most scary part, this was not like that, we knew our main character, we knew what he looked like & what he was capable of very early on, but he never stopped being intimidating & keeping us on the edge of our seats for his next scene.I loved this movie, it isnt perfect, but it is solid & I'm planning on going to see it again.",

    "text": "I wouldn't watch it again and the ending and post credits scene are bad but the movie as a whole was perfectly watchable and the villain was played with such enthusiasm that it's hard to not enjoy watching him on some level. If you watched this just as some action/horror flick on a Sunday afternoon you'd think it was decent. Its worst mistake comes in the form of trying to associate itself with the MCU and people automatically set the bar so high with that. If you're curious give it a watch and I doubt you'll think you wasted that much of your life, doubt you'll watch it again but don't believe the reviews which doomed it to a 17 percent on RT. I'd put it at a 50 percent or so. It's perfectly watchable and quickly forgettable but far from the worst thing out there.",

The storyline that doesn't flow even seems stiff. The depiction of Morbius and Lucian is also sorely lacking. It's too soon to get the characters morbius and Lucian. Lucian?? I don't think he's a villain here, but a reinvigorate who forgets about him. Such an ordinary and boring dialogue, it is not memorable. The rest of the supporting cast didn't quite help much. It's just a cast that appears at a glance and doesn't have any impact. Cast selection??? Two FBI agents who are not very good. Bad. The two FBI options that were made were funny but not funny. Imposing unnecessary comedic elements. It is precisely the cuteness that comes with seeing Tyrese Gibson perform seriously. What's worse?? The fight scene is also a pity. It doesn't look wow or amaze us. In fact, we are presented with ordinary fight scenes. Only the visual effects are indeed a bit pleasing to the eyes of Vulture's life in the last credits of the film. Which is true enough. Very clear = this movie is very forced. Eliminates the superhero element. Salute to Jared Leto.",

This leads to one of the biggest issues in the movie.The scene to scene editing is terrible. This movie feels like there are parts missing between scene transitions. It is a simple movie to follow but it feels very disjointed. Then you have the piss poor writing where things just happen to the benefit of the characters making a series of coincidences that feel absurd.There are some after credits scenes that show Sony is just trying to milk this Marvel stuff for all its worth. An ending scene that makes absolutely no sense based upon what happened in the movie.Don't bother watching this is my advice.",

Everything beyond the base concept of a man turning into a vampire is actually coherent, the intentions of each character are clear as day, and the story unfolds in quite a suspenseful way, unlike so many other superhero movies. So at the end of the day, the script is easy to follow and leaves you with something to think about.The directing and cinematography on the other hand are evidently rushed. The camera is often jumping around the set aimlessly, which clearly points to lack of organization rather than a less skilled director/editor (some action sequences for example worked wonders in conveying visual information in seriously quick cuts). And while some of the sets are true works of art, others are totally confusing, with flashy colors serving no real purpose. The vfx work was good but uninspired and rather cartoonish, which again points towards carelessness on the production's side.And of course Marvel had to butcher the otherwise rather emotional ending for the sake of shoving the movie in their collection of blockbusters. Unless they start putting real effort into their productions, the craze with their movies will eventually die out, leaving behind nothing but a pile of flashy and meaningless footage.",

Like any other 13 year old boy, Jared Leto experiments on himself to cure his desire to become a real man. He succeeds in creating a bat-juice that cures his debilitating disease and also turns him into a vampire with super strength and other superpowers and stuff. As expected his best buddy boy, who's also suffered from a debilitating disease, ceases the opportunity and turns himself into a vampire as well.So they fight. And Jared Leto wins.But why is Jared Leto involved with this at all? Wasn't ruining one comic book character enough for him. Is he going to destroy them all?Sony really outright refuses to learn from other studios mistakes. The only times Sony has released something somewhat comprehensible, was all projects where the actual artists had most of the actual control. Like \"Once Upon A Time In Hollywood\", which was also produced and distributed by Sony.This movie however, feels like everyone showed up on set with a white flag. Surrendering under the stupendous pressure of the studio, and making a deliberate and debilitating choice not to give a single fu**.It's way too dark and ugly to look at. Just mostly black, blue and green, but mostly black. It sounds like a toilet. There was an instance where the played the exact same sound effect 3 times in a row. Not to mention the instantly forgettable score and inappropriate soundtrack choices. Just amazing.If you are an aspiring filmmaker, I recommend watching this movie as a pitch perfect example, on how not to make a good or even passable film.If you enjoy \"100 minute car accident compilations\" this might tickle you just right, as well.Hold onto your throats! So you wont throw up. It's Morbius!",

The fight scenes seem more like 2000s matrix reloaded CGI.The end credits had no context to the story other than to try and show Sony is doing its own mcu that it controls and feels forced.The movie lacks originality, direction and purpose. Why sony chose to make this so close to the Batman film I don't know it's abit bay overload despite them being different franchises.Save yourself the time skip this one.",

    "text": "We all know the strange, pathetic tale of the Morbius movie by now so I won't reiterate but from the mind of someone who works at a movie theater and therefore has had no escape from the ads: it's not complete garbage. I know coming from a guy who's seen nearly 5k movies and has an incredibly strange take on things that statement may be a surprise but let me break it down.The opening and end credits aesthetic is great and I love its neon-y vibe. However, it's not enough to save the rest of the mid-2000s Marvel Studios feel, like I'm watching the 2005 Fantastic Four again... or the Silver Surfer movie... or Fant4stic.The past few years has given everyone a chance to realize where they stand between Jared Leto as an actor. There are those who will support him to the end of time, and there are sane people. His infamous approach of \"method acting\" has been a hot topic, from sending his co-stars dead things on Suicide Squad to (and this is just my assumption) peeing on everything to mark his territory on House of Gucci. On Morbius, it's been revealed that he walked with crutches everywhere and held up everyone's time. Even as someone who calls themself an actor, I gotta say, that's a pretty trash thing to do.As Morbius is set in the same universe as the Venom movies, the width of said universe is still a mystery. Here, we discover that the X-Men are a thing, as Jared Harris (as Morbius' childhood caretaker) says that he could send the kid to a \"gifted school upstate\" after mini Morb fixes an expensive machine with a ballpoint pen.Having seen a number of Leto's films over the years (10, to be exact), I can't help but wonder what his \"method\" was for each role. If he really did go live on the streets and get addicted to drugs for Requiem for a Dream, then at least the CGI for his super soldier chest is good. As for the vamp face (which looks straight out of season 1 Buffy), that chunk of budget must've been part of Leto's salary.Matt Smith is Milo, Morb's \"brother\", brother in quotes as they grew up in the same hospital, and, once he's stolen Morb's cure for their unspecified missing DNA disease, he becomes a scenery scarfing fairy who dances more randomly yet less cringefully than Spider-Man 3.The writing leaves A LOT to be desired but this is to be expected from the scribes of The Lost Witch Hunter and Gods of Egypt. Director Daniel Espinosa, I've only seen Life and that was fine if not forgettable. Morbius feels less like a contemporary Marvel movie and more as if it were made in 2006, got stuck in a time capsule and was unearthed in 2019 to try to touch up before releasing it to the masses after No Way Home. Is it bad? Yes. Is it fun to riff? Oh, most definitely.",

It's overall just really weak. Most of the dialogue feels like a placeholder for them to come it and rewrite it later for a final draft that never happened. On the whole, it felt unfinished, and like the first part of a series. Out of all MCU movies and MCU-tangential movies (like Venom and Let There Be Carnage) so far, I'd say this one was the weakest.All that said, I didn't hate it. I didn't particularly like it that much, either, but I wouldn't be opposed to a rewatch later down the line. Even considering my complaints, I'd be lying if I said I didn't still have a good time watching it.",

I had walked into the Morbius theatre with my family, slightly worried and had a feeling I'd be disappointed due to leaks and the removal of Spider-Man from the movie. I was wrong. When Dr Micheal Morbius said the phrase, those 3 words, \"It's Morbin Time\", I screamed and cried all at once. I scried. This is a beautiful movie and, to quote Martin Scorsese, \"rawest and purest from of cinema to be created.\" This movie surpasses the godfather for me, and when the words \"It's Morbin Time\" were uttered, the whole cinema scried with joy and happiness, popcorn flew everywhere.Well done, Jared. You've successfully played in the best movie to every exist, as well as the only movie to sell a morbillion tickets. You deserve all of it.",

The constant CGI is too much (was there even one shot without?), and the script was weak and predictable. There was nothing new to tell here, and it was all just ticking by and nearing the end, where the big \"good guy\"/\"bad guy\" battle happens. At least Venom has a point of bringing something new-ish. Being a \"bad person\" character and make it in a sort of charming way (although Deadpool was the first one to hit that off and Venom 2 was pretty awful)... that been said, to start of a proper series of this character, it flawed massively, and I'm not even slightly interested in a sequel (although that's what they hoped for clearly). If you didn't see this, just wait till it's on Netflix and save you the money.",

    "text": "Some scenes can be potential and should be developed for the plot but the execution feel rushed. That's what makes this movies's duration is kind of short and even boring. Jared Leto's acting is quite helping this movie. For the others looks quite descent. Maybe because they don't get much portion for thier roles. For CGI, They did great things\nfor the fighting scenes but for special effects on actors faces looks basic. I quite love the scores, especially Michael Morbius's theme. Rating is also big influence for some scenes in this movie. With PG-13, some scenes seems lost lot of atmosphere. Morbius should be depicted as scary and sadistic. In this movie, he depicted as less than in the comic. As happened in the previous two Venom movies.Overall this movie is \"light\" and just an filler movie for another Sony's big project in the future. I don't know what they plan next but Morbius is part of their plan. Let's hope Sony learns something and fix its for their next movies. I'm not recommend this movies but if you are fan of Morbius and Sony Cinematic Universe, you can watch it.",

    "text": "Aside from the amazing Morbius memes and funny reviews, I decided to watch it just to see how \"bad\" it was because this movie was absolutely review-bombed. I was really curious because I'm a movie fan and comic book movie fan, and I've seen plenty of bad movies. So now having seen it, I can honestly say... it wasn't that bad lol. I'd call it \"underwhelming\" and \"mediocre\" over bad. If you ask me, I think the Venom movies were bad, with Venom 2 being even worse. But why are the Sony anti-hero solo movies having a bad trend? Is it the direction, the CGI, the writing, the music?For Morbius, it wasn't any of those. All of those were fine actually. What made it lackluster was that the events were so minuscule and short, and there were these abrupt transitions between many scenes that made you feel like it was edited down a ton. The movie was short, and what happened in the short runtime wasn't much. At all. It felt incomplete and watered down. And the villain's change of heart was a bit too irrational for what his character was set up to be. The action sequences, few that they were, were so dark in lighting - the final battle in particular. I couldn't make sense of what was happening because I couldn't see anything. Then of course the after-credits scene that ties this universe with Spider-Man's universe felt forced and didn't make very much sense.It was still a decent movie. I enjoyed the music, the characters, the acting, and the CGI. But to validate the negative reviews of it, it's without question that as a Marvel-based blockbuster, it fell flat. It doesn't meet the standards or expectations of a Marvel movie. One big reason for that flaw is Sony and their production tactics. They baffle me honestly. Sony in recent years has been pretty bad with allowing their movies be fully developed (Resident Evil, Uncharted, Venom, etc.). They touch the surface and then stop. When it's Disney/Marvel at the helm, it's a different story. So Morbius of course is cursed with being a Sony-produced film. Kraven may follow in the same path.Bottom line, Morbius was good but it was underwhelming, short, and lackluster for what it was introducing. The movie I thought was incredibly bad, unentertaining, and cheesy was Moonfall. I encourage Morbius haters to watch Moonfall and you'll likely look at Morbius in a better light.",

Too short and fast to see the development of the characters, but after 20 minutes watching it i was so bored that i was pleased it wasn't any longer. I have no idea what comic these people read, because there's nothing of it in it. And again this compulsion for changing the physical features of the comic characters. As example: Martine Bancroft. She's blonde and white. I just can't stand this inclusion madness, it ruins everything. We have to stand these terrible scripts, lazy action scenes AND ALSO our comic character features being changed. If the comic charachter is black or asian, or white, or whatever... just pick actors who looks like that! Is not much to ask. It's just all a huge mess. Sony S. O. B.",

The movie was sure not bad, but the spark was missing. They obviously tried to make a nice movie, with nice characters and a nice plot. Maybe that was the problem: it was too nice. Venom sure was on another level. Like others said, don't make those movies for children. Give us something more. We don't want a Disney movie. The characters had potential at first, but at the end they seemed shallow and uninteresting. I liked the police guys! Seeing Morbius work with them would have been interesting. But no. I don't know the comics, so I have no idea where this is leading to. But I feel they wasted the potential. It's just another superhero film with a superhero plot: strange experiment leads to superhuman powers, superhero has to learn to control them, a love interest is introduced, a villain appears, we have a fight - THE END.Why.",

    "text": "I would've never thought that anyone could mess up a Morbius movie. Not only fail miserably but make it so predictable.And the story... It almost seemed we were back in the 40s and 50s. It is way past time writers learn they can't just act as if the people watching these movies know nothing about genetics and science. In the 80s and the 90s a movie like this might have been successful, but not in these times.Even Marvel phase 3, had the common sense to try to give better explanations for the powers of the characters. How they even tried to connect the super soldier serum, all the way from the Wakanda heart shape flower, to Captain America, to the Hulk. How even Carol Danvers needed the exotic energies of the Tesseract Cube to have the powers she had. With Spider-Man they just said it was a spider and left everything else in the air, trying to avoid saying that a simple radioactive spider gave Peter Parker those powers.In this movie we have Michael Morbius trying to find a cure for his genetic disease, using the genes of vampires bats. He creates a genetic cocktail, and immediately he becomes not only something else but something else with powers.It would've helped this movie a lot, if Michael either found bats that had developed in a cave with exotic minerals or energies in it, or if Michael had discovered a new form of radiation that had amazing mutagenic properties. The essential to help sell the idea that adding bat genes could have such an effect on a person. They could've even given it a supernatural touch if they wanted to.Instead the movie immediately goes to full on vampiric mode, and if that wasn't bad enough, the movie not at all surprisingly enough without any explanation gradually removes Michael option for surviving without having to feed on the blood of people. A completely foreseeable move that didn't came as a surprise at all.If anything this movie fails completely really because of that. It's too predictable. Of all the things they could've done, that would've opened several other options for sequels they went with the worst possible story.Performances from the cast was okay at best, and almost unwatchable at times. And the only thing salvageable are the mediocre special effects.Even I could've written a better story for Morbius, than what Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpeless did.Just another wasted opportunity. And a movie to fade away from memory as a bad dream.",

    "text": "I've already started getting heavy, right? So... I expected it to be a bomb, but I didn't know it was going to be almost a nuclear one. The film has no concern with its own text, with its own plot, with its own characters (few, unnecessary and unimportant), a complete disregard for everything it sets out to do.Without any special, interesting or minimally acceptable point, the film can't be enough to be an \"okay\". Sony wanted to score with another success, embarking with Venom (which even, it's not great things), but Morbius managed to be even worse in all points that Venom was \"okay\".Characters without any substance, logic broken because the script needed it, blatant clich\u00e9s, visual effects very more or less, performances worthy of laughs, the script looking like it was made by an inexperienced, the direction without any respect, zero blood and violence (for a Vampire movie), ugly, uninspired action, expository and soap opera-like dialogue, stupid decisions, and more.",

The special effects in this movie were great, but the art of telling the story just isn't there. I think the director had a problem turning an idea into a movie. All the elements are there...it just starts off so slow that you are nearly sleeping when things get good. If they took the first half of the movie, and threw it away.... and then added a little story to the last half, this movie could have been great, but I feel like they fell short. It was an \"ok\" movie, but nowhere near the film it should have been. It is a shame when there are really great actors, but the construction of the movie plays like a collection of trailers from different movies. There was too much character building, and I think he movie loses some of its' audience early on because of it. Just tell he story for crying out loud! Is it a superhero movie? A buddy movie? A love story? A spy movie? Pick a genre and stick with it. This was a bad screenplay for a great idea. I loved the comic book as a kid, but if I had seen the movie before reading the comic book... I wouldn't have purchased the comic book.",

The only genuinely good thing about this film was the special effects.And besides all of this, promoting animal cruelty for the sake of saving more of the human plague has never really been my jam.",

But it doesn't help much. It's all a blurry mess.It's mostly crass, predictable and dull... but it's better than Venom.I know, \"better than Venom\" is a very low bar. But I actually did watch Morbius all the way through. Venom (and its sequel) just had me fast forwarding chunks of it.So... I suppose if you have some time to kill and it's on a service you already have, then it might be worth a watch. But it's not worth going out of your way to watch it.",

    "text": "Morbius is set in the Morbground, a realm where morbsters were banished after war broke out with humans, in the year 201X. The Morbground is sealed from the surface by a magic morbarrier with a singular gap at Mount Morbbott. A human child falls into the Morbground from Mount Morbbott and encounters Morbey, a sentient Morb who teaches the player the game's mechanics and encourages them to raise their \"LV\", or \"LOVE\", by gaining \"EXP\" through killing morbsters. When Morbey attempts to kill the human, the human is rescued by Morbiel, a morberly goat-like morbster, who teaches the human how to survive conflict in the Morbground without killing. She intends to adopt the human, wanting to protect them from Morbgore, the king of the Morbground.The human eventually leaves Morbiel to search for Morbgore's castle, which contains the morbarrier to the surface world. They encounter several morbsters, such as the skeletons Morbs and Morbyrus, two morbrothers who act as sentries for the Morbdin forest; Morbdyne, the head of the morbal guard; Morbys, the kingdom's royal scientist; and Morbaton, a robotic television host Morbys created. Most of the morbsters are fought, with the human choosing whether to kill them or to spare and possibly befriend the morbster. During their travels, the human learns that many years ago, Morbriel (NOT MORBIEL), the son of Morbgore and Morbiel, befriended the first child who fell into the Morbground and was adopted by Morbgore and Morbiel. When the child abruptly died, Morbriel returned the body to the surface. The humans then attacked and killed Morbriel, causing Morbgore to declare war. In the present day, Morbgore has already collected six human souls, of which he needs one more to break the magic morbbarrier.The game's ending depends on how the player handles encounters with morbsters. If the player is on their first playthrough without killing (or killed some but not all morbsters) the human arrives at Morbgore's castle and learns that a morbster's soul is also needed to cross the barrier, forcing them to fight Morbgore. Morbs stops the human before their confrontation, revealing that the human's \"LOVE\" is an acronym for \"level of violence\" and \"EXP\" for \"execution points\". Morbs judges the human based on their accumulated \"LOVE\" and \"EXP\". The human then fights Morbgore, but Morbey interrupts, killing Morbgore and stealing the human souls. With the aid of the rebellious souls, the human defeats Morbey, falls unconscious, and awakens on the human side of the morbarrier. They then receive a phone call from Morbs, detailing the state of the Morbground after the human's departure. This ending is known colloquially among fans as the \"Morbal\" ending.If the player kills no morbsters after completing a \"Morbal\" ending, they can complete the \"Morbifist\" route. Morbey is revealed to be a reincarnation of Morbriel accidentally created by Morbys's experiments. During the fight with Morbgore, Morbiel interrupts the battle and is joined by the other morbsters the human befriended. Morbey ambushes the group, absorbing the souls of all the humans and morbsters in order to take an older Morbriel's form. The human connects with their friends during the ensuing fight, eventually defeating him. Morbriel reverts to his child form, destroys the morbarrier, and expresses remorse to the others before leaving. The human falls unconscious and is awoken to see their friends surrounding them, with the knowledge of the human's name: Morbisk. The morbsters reintegrate with the humans on the surface, while Morbisk has the option of accepting Morbiel as their adoptive mother.A third ending known as the \"No Morbcy\" or \"Morbocide\" ending ensues if the player kills all the morbsters. When Morbisk reaches Morbgore's castle, Morbs attempts and fails to stop Morbisk. Morbey kills Morbgore in an attempt to gain morbcy, but he is killed by Morbisk. Morba, the first fallen child, then appears and destroys the universe. To enable further replays of the game, Morbisk must give their soul to Morba to restore the universe, which will permanently alter all subsequent Morbifist routes.",

Five steps back in that regard.The whole advertisement for the movie was a bold faced lie, no connections to Marvel, it's another Sony desaster they knew was too bad to stand on its own.So, so bad.

Yes, the story goes quickly and you're told everything you need to know within the first quarter, but I appreciated them not drawing it out. I also saw some elements of Dracula Untold in this movie and I thought that was cool.Ultimately, I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go in knowing that this isn't as big of a production as some of the other movies.

I had fun watching it. Action was easy to follow along. Leto, Arjona and Matt Smith were great. I'm surprised how little of Tyrese was actually in this. I thought his part would be bigger. This movie gave me The Incredible Hulk vibes but just with vampires. Overall I felt it was a good entry for what seems to be Sonys larger Spider-Man universe. 2 mid credit scenes that add a lot to the future of all this. Very exciting stuff ahead!",

This is more akin to a trip to the station to check out the train wreck. You watch a flick with Jared Leto for the same reason you watch a modern-day Steven Seagal flick: you want to see just how terribly he did - and if you get some entertainment out of the whole charade, that's a bonus.Leto mumbles and shuffles his way through this movie with his usual utter ineptitude, and looks very pretty for the camera, so if you came here to see Jared Leto play Jared Leto while pretending to be a method actor playing a vampire, you'll get exactly what you want out of this.Fortunately, there are also some genuinely good actors in this movie. Seeing Matt Smith ham it up is a pure joy, and the weird special effects barely detract from that. Adria Arjona deserves more recognition for carrying much of the film (as well as dragging a seemingly half asleep Leto through all the scenes they share).I wish there was more of a plot and more world building, and I wish Smith had more screen time, but I also wish they'd cast an actual actor to play Morbius, and written a screenplay that had something - anything! - to do with the comic books, and had special effects that don't look like a mid-tier Netflix show. Obviously, we don't always get what we wish for.Is this a good movie? Of course not. Was I entertained throughout its 100 minutes? Yes. And that's, to be honest, more than I expected.",

Or something.I didn't dislike the film. But I was far from impressed.The script was hollow and really easy to read from the beginning.The acting was good. The visuals were good.

Its a way downgrade from venom. Im glad i didnt waste money on this sony monstrocity.4/10.",

I'm angry why so many scenes in the trailer don't come in included in this movie? 60% of the scenes in the movie trailer are not dimmed (a) Can last 2 hours more. That invites anger That fan. They use Spider-Man to do it movie promotion is. The part that disappointed me was the last credit scene. Why? Just why? 'Turn off continues (5) So my rating for this film is 7/o *. It's fun.

Because it actually had a decent story: Dr Morbius spends his entire life to find a cure for his rare illness that he and his best friend have, but when he finally finds the cure with the help of certain bats, he also finds a horrible curse. He has to consume blood every few hours, but of course, he doesn't want to kill anyone at the same time. But the other side of him can't help but to hunt and kill and consume blood.I'd give this film a 5 because it wasn't good but it wasn't bad, it had some good qualities, but it seemed like a typical storyline about a guy who turns into a vampire, but still, it's the best vampire film I've seen.",

    "text": "Finally got around to this... everything wrong about this film could be summed up very easily and there's no one else to point the finger at but Sony... they just don't know what they're doing.The failings of Morbius do not lie with the cast. In fact, the movie was pretty well cast imo. Tyrese seemed unnecessary. Too recognizable an actor to have such a small role; a bit distracting.The treatment of the material and the approval of such a thin script are the major issues. Leto has been on the receiving end of some stick for not being bankable as a comic-adapted actor but Zack Synder's Justice League proved that his Joker is pretty awesome in its own way, and The Suicide Squad [Director's Cut] may support that if it sees the light of day \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffc(c'mon HBOMax)First off, the setting of the movie should have remained in Europe. The Americanization of the majority of the film - especially the climax - was too glossy and cliche. Matt Smith's wardrobe was laughable. The CGI, while at times stunning, was overdone and very choppy.For the palette of the Marvel-cinema-fan, a less grotesque version of Morbius' vampire may have gone over better and also more digestible to the average movie goer.There is a very important rule in making commercial vampire fare: either go for the romantic or go for broke a la Blade (1998). Morbius tried to straddle both visions and ended up a mess. It didn't appeal to the romantic in me neither the horror fan. A more weighted score may also have added some much needed texture.The runtime was also woefully short and motivations and gravitas were lacking throughout. But I guess for those who paid to see it, the runtime was a blessing.Leto is too good of an actor to be saddled with such garbage. I hope that another director, with a more patient and evolved sensibility can right this franchise and resuscitate it because I would definitely love to see more of Leto in the role but Sony needs to smarten the f#%* up.5/10.",

Just a classic anti-villain origin story. The movie gets really bad when they fully introduce the bad guy.The truth is this is the exact same as a lot of other marvel movies just with a less interesting story. Its hard to make these movies not seem like fan service when they are always teasing characters from other movies.",

In my opinion I loved this movie ten times more then suicide squad. The only thing that left me questioning was the very ending, but that's only because I'm not a gaint spriderman fan.

The pacing is way too fast and the characters are completely one dimensional. Some lines are hilariously bad e.g: \"you don't wanna see me when I'm hungry\". Boring, predictable and forgettable, with performances ranging from mediocre to downright terrible. The only good thing about this movie is the score, which is mostly fine, but elements of it are actually pretty great.

I thought my life was over and I attempted to end it all. Then, I saw a trailer for the film Morbius. I had never heard of the character but I loved marvel so I thought I would give it a tryWhen I entered the cinema, I had a feeling of joy flow through me. I felt happiness for the first time in awhile during this film. Jared Leto destroyed as Dr Michael Morbius (who is not venom). His performance was immaculate compared the lacklustre portrayal of the joker in the 2016 DC film \"Suicide Squad\". Matt Smith as the villain Milo is menacing but also sympathetic and he acts beautifully in the best scene of the film, in which he dances shirtless with his new powers. Many of my questions were answered watching this film. I can finally confirm that1. He IS a marvel legend\n2. He is super fit (Pilates do help)\n3. He does need to consume blood to live\n4. He is NOT venom (He is doctor Micheal Morbius)After the film, I came out with a new outlook on life. I recently found a new partner and my family have accepted me back into the family. All because I took them to see the film.Morbius changed my life and it could change yours.",

It is by no means a masterpiece, and the proximity of its release to The Batman (2022) certainly didn't do it any favors. If you go in with low expectations you will likely enjoy the film. There are some non-sensical moments and the movie feels a bit rushed, but overall it's a decent rendition of one of the less popular Marvel characters. If you are a Marvel fan it's worth a watch.",

For all critics, especially the \"CGI\" naysayers, I respond \"did this DO what it was meant to do? Which was ENTERTAIN?\"If yes, as for me, that equals success, it's what I PAID for...and again, if you \"put down your pens/criticisms\" and focus on the film as a whole and not a sum of its parts, Morbius delivers on character development/action/and desire for more.BOTTOM LINE: If you haven't seen-DO SO and if it's still in your local theater-DEFINITELY see it on the big screen!!",

Storyline lacked depth overall - 1st half hour or so seemed great, they set the scene well but then the rest of the film seemed rushed with a basic plot. Not a terrible film but feel a sequel would need to be a lot better as obviously this one has not gone well with a lot of people. Think they could with targeting an older audience with this type of film. Spiderman + the mcu in general appeals to all ages, but this one feels as though its missing a bit of edge to it.",

Sell the rights to the characters to Disney/Marvel Studios and let them have full creative control. With each passing film, it has become abundantly clear that Sony cannot make a good comic book movie anymore without the direction of Kevin Feige and Marvel Studios. The only good thing to come out of Sony with Spiderman was Into the Spiderverse. But with that exception, they haven't handled the ip well since the mid 2000s. I hope this movie flops, so that Sony has no choice but to cave and finally give Feige and co full creative control of Spiderman and his related mythos. Leto has now arguably been in both the worst DC movie, and Marvel movie ever made.",

Ever since my first viewing I've seen Morbius 47 times and plan to buy this film so I can see it more than ever before.This film is must watch, show it to your friends, show it to your grandparents, show it to you parents, your kids, your pets, any living being.

    "text": "So I went into this movie with low expectations thinking it wouldn't be great & I wouldn't like it because I happened to glance at some of the reviews & ratings here right before I saw the movie.Now that I've seen it, I swear I'm convinced that some reviewers here are either so snobby and elitist or they're just plain cynical and/or didn't actually watch the movie and just assumed it was bad because it's a comic book movie that Jared Leto is in.'Cause the truth is it was so good! Not perfect, but waaay better than what those low ratings, negative reviewers will have you think. I mean just because something doesn't turn out the way you wanted it to be, doesn't mean it's not good. So please grow up and stop with the negativity.This movie was entertaining, the way that Morbius and his movement & powers are depicted is so cool. Yeah the plot is predictable but it's an origin story movie, it's supposed to be simple and predictable, it's only an intro to the character, so be patient. Jared Leto did wonderfully with the character. His performance felt so natural & unforced. The character suits him pretty well. The CGi was good, the fight/action scenes were smooth and captivating. Yes, it would've been even cooler to see a darker R-rated version of the story, but again, that doesn't make it bad. And it was still fairly dark for a PG-13 movie too.In a way, I'm glad I went into this thinking it would be bad 'cause it was a pleasant surprise for me that I thoroughly enjoyed it.So don't listen to anyone and go see it and judge for yourself because some ratings and reviewes are not always reliable, they tend to be too negative these days. And keep in mind that some of them might rate it down just 'cause they don't like Jared Leto or another actor in it. Or they're unfairly judging the whole movie based on the mid-credit scenes which have nothing to do with the plot of the movie. Or just 'cause they wanna complain, since that's everyone's favorite pass time lately.The movie was good, it's doing fairly well in the box office so far, and definitely deserves a higher rating. Watch it with an open mind and enjoy!",

To really balance, I should have given it a 10. I can't really understand the hate. Maybe it's because I'm not a Marvel fanboy or a comic book guy. I've been around a while and had never even heard of Morbius. I went it knowing nothing other than there is a lot of 1 star hate reviews. I really don't get the hate.I just know I.enjoyed the movie for what it is. A decent movie to escape into for a couple hours that doesn't suck. I thought the CGI was good. I liked the vampire effects (the sonar and whooshing around) and I liked how it was filmed. Sure there may have been bits lacking here and there. There is not the dynamic back and forth dialog and witty comebacks you'd see from Whedon and the Russo brothers. But it's not that. It's dark and gloomy . Maybe bits here and there might have been rushed but nothing that warrants a 1 star from my side of the screen.The real point of me taking time to write words down is judge for yourself. Don't buy the 1 star and don't buy the 10 start (unless they are trying to balance out the score).",

I could make a list with hundreds of movies that are worse, way worse, than Morbius (like Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man) but it's pointless since people voting this movie down expected 200 billion dollar movie like Iron-Man although it clearly says in the title that it's not.Morbious is to the point. Not a single boring scene or moment in a whole movie from start to finish. Is it really 9/10?! No. Could it have been better? Yes, a bit. Acting is good, often excellent, sometimes over the top. Plot is light and has some sudden twists that are good, and some that are bad. Would I watch it again? No. But I wouldn't watch Guardians of the galaxy again either (and that movie bored me to death at some parts).",

That's pretty much the case here, of course (weak protagonist gets a superpower and has to fight against suddenly empowered opponents), but there's more focus on character consideration than just a silly chain of boss fights like in all of them other Marvel films. The dark atmosphere suits the subject very well, the actors do a very good job for acting in a film for simple minds. Unfortunately, the characters all remain linear and one-dimensional, as we know it from American action films. Nevertheless, I am grateful to the production that, for once, it did without the umpteenth minute-long final fight and it was refreshingly short. Technically, everything also fitted very well into the overall picture. The special effects are only slightly exaggerated, and the craftsmanship is very good - this also applies to the director's work.",

    "text": "I walked into the theater with low expectations based off of the reviews. And this one exceeded my expectations.I'll start off with what was wrong with this movie. I never really had time to connect with many characters due to the pace of the movie, it seems as if they were rushing to get the film over with. The most exciting parts of the movie almost seem too short. It leaves the viewer wanting more, but never actual gets the chance to show its true potential. The script is also pretty corny. Some scenes that were meant to be serious, actually made me laugh. They spent a ton of money on a movie to write in some sentences that shouldn't belong outside of a 4th grade classroom.Then again, Morbius did have some things going well for it. The CGI was phenomenal! I noticed myself jumping up and down in my chair during some of the fight scenes. The effects and the action alone had my attention and kept me locked in for the whole run-time. I never found myself bored during the movie however each fight scene with the CGI seemed to short to really lock into. Leto did a phenomenal job as Morbius and I hope to see him even more later on in the MCU. I thought the villain was a solid choice, the way they built up his background helped me connect with the character and end up rooting for Morbius to win because I had grown to hate the villain too.Overall: This movie is entertaining and held my focus until the credits. The CGI and fight scenes are beautiful, I just wish there were more of them. Leto did very well in embodying this character, and it looks like he's here to stay. The villain was great. Marvel could've extended the run time to give us the extra 30 minutes we needed to connect with this movie. They also could've hired a different writer. In some scenes it felt like I was listening to two people reading their text messages aloud.",

So predictable that you can pretty much figure out how it's all going to play out within the first 10 minutes. Nothing even close to standing out from any of the actors. Mostly though, the horrible overdone CGI is what makes it a bore. Almost every fight scene is exactly the same and half of that you can't even tell what's going on except *yep they're fighting again\" due to the unnecessary amount of walls/floors/ceilings being destroyed that it just becomes a mess of \"stuff\" happening.I'm sure we'll have to endure another 2 of these stinkers though because people insist on tossing cash at anything Marvel.

The detectives were annoying and useless. It was humorous when one sarcastically told the other detective, \"I got it, don't move or anything.\" As if the script was self aware of how they just stand around with a overzealous and false sense of relevancy and importance.The extra scenes involving Lucien \"Milo\" were a bit exhausting. It also threw me off when Morbius called himself \"Venom.\"\nOverall the graphics were mesmerizing, as well as the introduction of the vampire and his evolving abilities.I'm looking forward to a sequel with Spider-Man. And of course his hot newborn vampire love interest.",

    "text": "I watched Morbius without reading any of the reviews, but I'm well aware of the general negative criticisms towards it. I wanted to form my own opinion, and I have to say that it's really not as bad as they say. It's not mind blowing by any means, but it wasn't a waste of time watching it either. Avoiding spoilers, I do recommend taking all of the advertising with a grain of salt.I generally don't like to compare Marvel movies to each other, as each film has their own themes, atmosphere, and purpose they have to work with. That being said, Morbius is an \"okay\" film in regards to being an anti-hero introduction film. I'm not too familiar with the Morbius comic book line, so I can't criticize how faithful the characters are to the comics, but it does have the dark tones that fit in well within the Sonyverse. Although Morbius does feel like a step-down in my opinion, if you enjoyed Venom or other movies of the like you might enjoy this one. I have no complaints with Jared Leto's performance, as well as with the rest of the cast. And the cgi was well done as well, especially when he uses his sonar ability. There's a lot of potential here for the future of Morbius through either a sequel or a tie-in with future films in the MCU and the Sonyverse.However I do have my share of criticisms. I was expecting this to be the darkest Marvel production to date. This was based on literally being about a monstrous vampire, and that the trailers portrayed the film as a movie about a doctor making themselves into a monster and their struggle with control. Unfortunately, that doesn't happen to the extent that's advertised. If you're expecting a moderately sized body count with lots of blood, I'm afraid you won't find that here. I will also say it left me feeling like there should've been more. More action, more tension, more blood. Most of that may have been the result of working within the confinements of a PG-13 rating, as most successful vampire films have the R rating including \"Blade.\" It also could have been the writing and directing as well, but I can't go without mentioning that this film faced major hiccups caused by a pandemic.With the prolonged production time, there were major changes and cuts made by the producers while in post in regards to continuity with the MCU and who knows what else. If this was released with a \"non-covid\" cut, it may have been what it strived to be. Until then, I'll be waiting to see what's next for Morbius. 5/10.",

Jared Leto, Oscar winner & consummate ageless weirdo, plays the conflicted doctor who as a child befriended a like minded (& bodied) blood sufferer, later played by Dr. Who's Matt Smith, soon becomes essentially a vampire due to his exposure to the bat bites which for the short haul cure him of his malady but after a spell he'll need blood to keep himself physically fit but as night follows day as Smith pilfers the magical elixir to cure himself, the stage is set for both former friends to be at each other's necks (sorry!) for final dominance. A lot of this hokum could've worked if there was a decent story to tell but there isn't much for the audience to sink its teeth into (again apologies!) & until someone gives producer Avi Arad the proper boot to his rear that he deserves, we can expect more entries into a universe no one really wants. Also starring Jared Harris as Leto's childhood doctor, Tyrese Gibson (wasted here!) as a FBI agent w/comedian Al Madrigal as his partner & Adria Arjona (who ironically worked w/David Tennant, another Dr. Who, on Amazon's Good Omens) wasted as well as the token victim to be saved.",

Matt Smith not so great. Maybe a different director who had more experience in either Horror or Super Hero movies would have been better choice.

    "text": "It was an okay movie. A lot of things go wrong but it could be worse.First of all the characters are white good to be honest. Jared Leto's performance was pretty much the best in the movie! The acting was really good, and the character development was OK... but I think that the negatives have a major impact on the outcome of the movie...\nThe plot is super quick! I mean there were some certain scenes where Morbius was changing environments so quickly. It's night, its day everything changes to quickly in my opinion... Plus they don't give you any backstory, I mean you don't know much about the characters and you don't have the chance to bond with them to create a more dramatic situation... furthermore I think the whole antihero idea was not good. I believe that Morbius as a character was more sinister and more diabolical than we could ever imagine, so making him an antihero, respecting other peoples lives and understanding the fact that he brought this \"virus\" in the world is something that in my opinion did not make any sense.... The movie could easily handle him as a big ass villain with great motivation and some great special effects, that the movie did already have... My biggest problem though is that the movie was bloodless. You cannot make a vampire movie without any blood! Making the movies PG-13, PG 15 is something that will frustrate the older audiences and I do not think that the younger audiences are willing to go to a vampire movie with Jared Leto casted as Morbius because it's not a part of their interests I guess. I'm in the way he drinks the blood from these bags is ridiculous! He's not secretely drinking vodka out of a KFC bag, he is Michael Morbius!!!Now the positives! It is really important to me that the movie did not make a fan of itself. Back in October venom two let there be Carnage, had a joke every three minutes... I will respect the fact, the Morbius had the respect to not include any goofy jokes that would indeed ruin the atmosphere of the movie even more... The address to remove it was dark and it couldn't affect you that much, cause the time period was changing constantly... But a huge benefit in my opinion are the special effects! Every CGI scene looked amazing, nothing made me wonder about it's originality, everyone could believe that what they were saying was real! That in my opinion is really important, I mean it's in action movie, it's a superhero movie and I like that a lot!So all in all, I find the movie enjoyable enough I think it's a great addition to the Marvel cinematic universe in general, and I really enjoyed it! The thing that worked for me the best, is the fact that movie isn't something you should be worrying about. I mean it's not a serious movie, it's a movie that you will see just to have fun, so go for it have fun, and dint get affected by the negativity of the web!!!!",

And for good reason!Genuinely one of the worst movies to ever be made. I would rather watch someone just breathe into the camera for 5 hours than watch this. I would be counting the amount of times they blink and it would still be more entertaining. Honestly, I would rather be locked inside a room with no entertainment and the only time I get to see people is when they bring me the slop for dinner, and that would be a more desirable situation than to have to watch this.I have trouble sleeping because of this movie, not because it scared me, but because I had a nightmare (which was the sequel to a pre-existing nightmare) wherein I was tied down to a chair and my eyes were forced open so I had to watch this.Overall, a solid 0/10 stars, maybe even dropping into the negatives, but I can't put that, so I gave it only one.",

    "text": "The only thing you need to do is read some reviews of this movie, watch the trailers and look at the guys who wrote the script. Those two \"writers\", can't actually write a decent script. Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, for the love of God, stop! Just STOP! You are not good writers, you never been and you will never be. These are the people who wrote Dracula Untold, Gods of Egypt , The last Witchhunter and Power Rangers, all of these movies back in the day would've gone straight to DVD or rental, now they get theatrical release because they have some starving big actor name attached to it. Horrible movies, not entartaining, scripts that seem written by 10 year olds. How these two hacks get work in Hollywood is beyond md, while there are people who sit on tons of good scripts and don't get a dime. Everything these two people touch, is horrible and flops massively, yet somehow, studios give them work. Beeing jewish has its benefits, I guess.As for this particular movie? Don't waste your money, buy some flowers for your wife/gf/bf whateva and go see Doctor Strange when it's in theaters.",

The fighting scenes were laughable. Morbius finds a cure to his condition within 10 minutes of the movie, he kills a few people, goes to jail. His friend, who is also sick takes the serum and turns into a douche. Mobius breaks out of jail and the next hour is just pointless running around. Finally he stops his friend and the movie ends abruptly. Also who thought it was a good idea to cast Tyrese Gibson as an FBI agent? Really? You couldn't have chosen someone who looked vaguely more like a cop? It was just so basic and pointless. Like why make a movie at all when there was this little effort involved.",

I enjoyed the soundwave cinematic effects; it was like you were reading a live action commic book. I don't understand why people are so critical. It's like they forgot how to get immersed in the movie and just be entertained. The intro was a little long but it did explain the relationship between Milo and Morbius well. Some of it was predictable but again I went to watch sci fi action flick and be entertained so I didn't mind this. I really liked the action.",

I haven't actually seen it but a friend of mine knows someone that shared a cab with the mother of a guy who's sister had a boyfriend that knows a guy from work who might've seen it, and he said that it's THE movie of all time. When they release it a third time in theaters across the globe I will definitely consider going.",

I honestly enjoyed Morbius from beginning to end and it didnt drag like Venom. But I cant wait for those two to battle. And i feel Andrew Garfields Spidey is more suited to handle the Sinister Six because i dont think Tom is ready for em. As for Jared Leto, he was lookin sexy af like he did back in his Urban Legend film days. I'd rate the movie 8.5/10. I only took away a few points because its extremely predictable and I figured out the whole plot (including the villain and all) just from the opening cave scene. Plus I want a Blade cameo since hes mentioned in the comics.",

Key word \"some\" because most of these effects were very cheap or didn't even make sense. The fight scenes between milo and morbius were pretty cool (except for the end were morbius used a bat hudoken.) Morbius himself (who btw is not venom) is blindly heroic we're at points it ends up very corny. The pacing was also pretty bad, the first 1hr and 1/2 (mostly when morbius was looking for milo) felt like 2 hours and the last 15 minutes happened in 15 seconds. But when it wasn't super sluggish it was pretty entertaining. Overall Morbius is a movie to watch with your friends as a joke once and a movie to torture your enemies with on replay.",

Not only is Jared Leto beautiful, but he is such a great actor! He really inhabited the role, making me simultaneously a bit scared of the darkness, and curious as to how he would use it. I think he did a great job exploring that darkness, and understanding that from pain can come heroism. Plus, as a disability advocate, I loved that a person with a disability was portrayed really well, if not by a person with the disability. I only wanted to see the reconnection on screen of characters that will hopefully happen in a future movie. I don't like cliffhangers that never can be resolved.",

Hence my low rating. Sony doesn't always bring the quality, but always brings the action. Think mid-2000s Hellboy, Elektra, Daredevil, and later Venom, because Sony has been churning out the same garbage for decades. Some parts were visually and conceptually well done, like how they explained his ability to fly or the fight scenes. I hope to see Smith in more large roles because his ability to be both the comic relief and evil villain simultaneously is incredible.",

So perhaps i went in with little doubt but at least the time we were introduced the vampire i was thinking to my self \"Hey this isn't even bad but instead pretty ok\".The plot wasn't anything special but it was ok enough just like the acting. Overall i was enjoying the movie and only thought about it ending at pretty much few minutes before it ended. That said i can recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a ok vampire movie made recently. Not sure what the problem was with everyone bashing this but as a non-marvel fan i thought it was entertaining enough. Sure it could have been better if it would have gone to the r-rating but as it was it deserved a 7.",

    "text": "It's not as bad as you would think. I feel like the average movie goer will enjoy it. If you wanna go on a date it's a fun date movie. Cool concept, lots of action, cool visuals(not spectacular.) .Just don't expect anything else from it. For the most part I actually think the acting and characters are great and are the best part of the movie. The worst part is the whole movie feels so rushed. No time dedicated to backstory or character development. Also the script was just so predictable in a bad way; for sure that's the second biggest weakest. It's marvel without the heart and great writing that's makes the MCU the MCU. It's like a slightly worst version of Venom. But at the end of the day it still kept me entertained. Not a masterpiece and not sure it was worth the price. But I don't regret my time.",

    "text": "An ethically ambiguous doctor gains vampiric superpowers in a misguided attempt to cure his own disease. Not only is this movie *actually* pretty good, but I can't figure out why anybody prefers the drivel of No Way Home in comparison. This is Jared Leto's first performance that made any sense to me. He grapples with his character's conflicting desires in a way that didn't make me nauseous. Matt Smith is an incredible villain. \"Milo\" and Morbius have great chemistry together, and the supporting cast is enjoyable. The funny FBI agent and Smith provide much needed comic relief in a film that takes itself just seriously enough. The action and direction were surprisingly good. I thought I was going to hate the ending, but I liked it a lot. In a world full of over the top superhero movies, this one holds its own in Sony's Spider-Man universe. Some shaky camera work at odd moments changes my score from an 8 to a 7.",

    "text": "Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse gave hope that Sony can actually handle Marvel properties properly. But it's clear after seeing Morbius that they don't have a grip on how to do these IPs justice. And for those who'd say \"yeah but Tom Holland's Spider-Man is successful.\" I'd say, you're right. It's fresh and new and produced by the MCU. The only hand Sony had in those were distribution and minor oversight by Amy Pascal (Sony lead producer).Both Venom films were just okay and barely palatable. Only saving grace is that Venom actually looks and sounds like Venom.Morbius failed to even live up to that.The most frustrating part of this movie was seeing small elements of a good story coming together but they never do. Fall's short on continuity, suspension of believe, acting (not including Leto who has drawn bad luck twice on comic book films), and majorly the writing and storytelling. I mean, no disrespect intended, but the writing team responsible did not have a track record indicating they were going to be successful on this project and that showed most evidently.I think it's time for Disney to go all in on recapturing the Marvel characters Sony has the rights to. Either by an exclusive deal to re-obtain them, or pull a 20th Century Fox and buy the company.Just a shame.",

Leto did as well as he (or anybody) could with what he was given (same with Hardy), but the poor guy can't seem to catch a break when it comes to comic book movies.Also, did we really need two separate Matt Smith dance scenes?

Morbius has quite a good beginning, telling Michael's background and struggles with his illness along with his friend Milo and also their hopes, this stage was actually very well done and set a good expectation, but things started to go downhill during the development stage, it just flew by and that engagement that started in the beginning stage started to disappear, I'd say development was nearly lacking as though there was some sort of need to get to then end quickly. By the time one gets to the end, the expectation is low, you already know that something is missing, and the movie just gives you a soft ending, the final battle was not impressive, two vampires fighting each other, and it didn't feel like it, no big surprises. It's disappointing, I'm a fan of monster and superhero movies, I thought of Morbius like a superhero/monster/villain combined, had high expectations about it, it's not bad but it could have been much better.",

I see now why morbius sold 100 trillion tickets. When dr michael morbius of the morbius (2022) exclaimed \"it's morbin time\" i cried so loud the security of theater morbius had to remove me from theater morbius(2022). There was actors, there was cgi, there was even a script. Some fan theories even suggest there was a plot! I love you morbuis2022. You are my love and live morbius2022.

    "text": "I have to admit that I had really been looking forward to watching \"Morbius\" ever since I saw the first trailer. And having been reading the comic books, I will say that Michael Morbius is one of my favorite Marvel characters, so it was nice that the character was finally brought to the big screen.But then the movie was delayed and delayed again, and once finally out a lot of bad reviews were swarming the movie, so I was actually somewhat reluctant and hesitant about actually sitting down to watch it. But I decided to ignore the bad reviews and go see how the movie would treat the comic book character.I LOVE THE MOVIE.",

Dr Morbius' internal struggle provides an extraterrestrial look into our own lives and our own struggles. While receiving some unnecessary hate, I believe this is one of marvel's top films, and it should be treated as such. It is unfortunate I have to give this film a 10/10, as it should be higher than a 10/10. Great work everybody.",

Michael Morbius, played by Jared Leto which did a job, the side characters were present and the antagonist was the bad guy. The soundtrack was made of music, and let's not forget how the special effects were effects. Finally, the plot was real, the action was the action I've ever witnessed and the dialogue was made of sentences.My favourite part was when he screamed \"IT'S MORBIN TIME\" and started morbin...My only complaint is that there could have been a little bit more \"IT'S MORBIN TIME\" catchphrases throughout the movie.In my opinion, 10 stars would never be enough to describe the movie of last century, so my final rating is:6 morbillion stars out of 10 !",

There was no proper development (story, character, etc.), and scenes just transitioned thoughtlessly as if they were running out of time.

    "text": "Morbius a great deal better than expected after hearing many negative reviews online. It gives the feel of a Marvel production & incorporates the the first vampire character with sophistication. It avoids the 'typical' vampire perceptions from other movies that are perceived to be 'cheesy' or 'romanticised'.Many people seem skeptical of Morbius coming the MCU franchise as it's the first time a vampire enters the universe on screen, & many people view vampires to be 'mythical' fantasy, with werewolves etc. Which may be deemed as significantly different from other Marvel realities. However, it doesn't involve the standard mythical aspect, instead it encapsulates more of the 'scientific reality' which is consistent throughout the MCU.Overall, I really enjoyed Morbius, it was refreshing to see such a different & darker character come to the screen and I'm looking forward to the next insertion of Morbius - hopefully with a cross-over with Spider-Man or Venom, from hints in the film.One thing to improve the flow & rating of Morbius would be to fill some timeline gaps. There was what appeared to be some jumps in time that could have easily been answered by e.g \"3 weeks later\" message on screen or some extra scenes; since the film only has a run-time of 148m an extra 15/20 minutes would be extremely beneficial to the storyline, the overall flow, the character developments & audience understanding.",

Morbius is the best, bad movie I've seen in a very long time that is so hilariously poorly written that it may end up being one of my favorite movie experiences this year. From new powers seemingly out nowhere that don't remain consistent, to a relatively bloodless movie about vampires. Horrible acting, horrible characters, horrible writing. Effects are pretty cool. Watch because it's funny.",

There's definitely a place for morbius in this world of many heros and villains, but it hasnt started off great. Casting is excellent, i wouldnt change anyone. Jarod and matt spot on. The relationships between all characters were seemingly rushed, as was the storyline. Maybe another half hour of character development would have been better. This is a very fast origin story. I think more attention to showing the pain of the blood disease and its effects on the characters, more attention to the friendship and bond of morbius and milo, dr emil and martine. I just didnt feel their pain or friendship much. I wouldnt watch morbius 2, but i would wantch a remake if someone else does a better job because i really like the characters. Its an ok film, worth watching as the action, characters and effects are very good.",

Vampire hero concept is fresh and interesting too. Looking forward to seeing more from Morbius story.",

I'd love to know the diffy between this and Dr. Strange or Iron Man. I just think it must be people don't really like Jared Leto. Luckily for me I LOVE HIM soooo well worth my money. I am about to watch it again. Hope there's a sequel, y'all need to stop messing up things for me lol.",

When it comes to the CGI and Editing of the film it was a bit quirky as during the fight scenes, especially in the climax fight I couldn't see who was hitting. Lastly, one thing a comic book hero movie fan looks forward to is the climax fight which I think is a disappointment in this film.",

The foolish morons nearby whom berated me for merely being a connoisseur of films, the ingrates who left the film because they could not differentiate perfection from rubbish, and finally the wannabe and so called 'critics' who give this film any less than 5 out of 5 stars, you can all go defecate on the streets, just like the barbarians and animals you are. I would say this film can even go on par with The Fast and Furious motion pictures. Overall, this movie truly deserves a perfect rating, if possible, beyond the normal standard of perfection, and beyond limitation.

However, its entertaining and that is what matters, and Matt Smith understood the assignment.Great entertainment .",

So over all Morbius is a very entertaining and compelling story throughout it's whole runtime and never proceeds to drag out or feel like it runs longer than it should. So yes please spend you time watching this magnificent piece of art and enjoy every single moment in life.",

The acting is much better than expected, I didn't even have an issue with Jared like I thought I would, he was fine! The thing that dragged it down the most is the goofy and laughable visual effects throughout; not just when the characters transition to and from their vampire alter egos, but while they're flying around leaving a weird trail of smoke coloured by their clothes, what an odd visual effect that is and it did not work at all for me. I also got a little giggle everytime Morbius had his \"Rick and Morty\" pupils, haha! The quick-dash effects also looked very stilted and fake. I don't know why the visuals can look so bad on such a high budget film in 2022 but it's a huge detracting factor for me, very distracting and takes you out of the emersion of the film. Otherwise, if you enjoy your standard Marvel/Sony flick this should be no exception.",

But I still walked in with an optimistic mindset.Wow was I proven right to be hesitant. This must be one of the worst superhero movies put to screen and one of the worst cinematic experiences I've sat through in a very long time.This movie from the first 10 minutes immediately felt off, scenes jumped from moment to moment without much context in-between. Each scene felt separate from one another and the lacked much connection or through line. Which doesn't help this already thin excuse of a plot as Morbius checks all the typical boxes as it tells a story about the generic science experiment gone wrong, to a man who deals with (insert medical condition), who must learn to control his powers and fight a villain with the same powers.The acting from all the cast felt bored and sloppy, the only actor who was putting in any work was Matt Smith who saved as many scenes as he could as he looked as if he was having the most fun during this film.The CGI was laughably bad, looking like an early 2000's movies and the third act left me looking at the screen and audibly ask \"Is that it?\"Don't waste your money on this movie, wait till it inevitably ends up on one of the numerous streaming services available and instead go and see The Batman again.",

    "rating": 10,
    "date": "2022-06-25",
    "text": "To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Morbius. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Morbius's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Vampire literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Morbius truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Morbius's existential catchphrase \"I am Morbius,\" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Daniel Espinosa's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. \ud83d\ude02\nAnd yes, by the way, i DO have a Morbius tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 morbIQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid \ud83d\ude0e",

Neat, but pointless.Lots of exposition despite being shown things 'you drank the red'. Really? Weak.Like someone had taken an old comic book and used it as the dialog and storyboard for the movie. The results are the sort of movie folks who don't enjoy comic books would point to and say 'because they're like that'.'If we don't induce a coma she'll stroke out'. Ok. Nice that the props folks got the right milky look for the propofol. But then no intubation? Just a snooze? Well, OK...The wandering FBI agents presumably serve some purpose but other than asking inane questions and being a bit Laurel & Hardy it's unclear what. They don't seem to move the plot on.",

It wasn't R rated, so, I wasn't expecting to see a lot of blood, nudes, sex, or mean language, like I guess many movie hatters here were expecting.The script could have been better, but it is not bad. I see many users criticizing it. However, all Disney Marvel movies follows similar approach. Their stories also varies completely from the original comic. So not sure why some people gave a low score to this Sony Marvel movie because they were expecting an R version, but gave higher scores to Disney Marvel's PG13 movies. I guess is because they are Sony Marvel movies hatters and there is nothing that could change it unless is a Mature rated movie version.\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

Jared was phenomenal!I found the film beautifully dark, entertaining, and worth every cent!",

This movie has awful pacing, mediocre acting, no thanks to Jared Leto, and a story that is best described as uninteresting. Overall Morbius is a move that started with no audience and left with an audience that only cared about how stupid it was. The logic of this movie makes little sense as well, the movie often just makes up what ever it wants just to progress the story. Overall, I would only suggest watching this movie if you want to turn your brain off and watch a stupid.",

But one day it all changed. And that day was a April 1st, 2022.How could I ever forget the day that changed my life. It went like any other I woke up in my fat sack of a body and could barely leave my bed. I would never leave my house for a movie, I would always put it on my tv. But today, today was different. For some reason there was this mysterious force that compelled me to watch a movie in theaters that day. And there was only one movie I could watch, and that was Morbius.Flash forward to the start of the movie. I needed to book 2 seats so I could fit comfortably. As I am watching the movie I start to relive my life starting with my mothers failed abortion. I saw my first words, my first steps, my first friend.All of a sudden I hear \"Pilates helps.\" I immediately dropped to my knees rolling in fat. I wanted to change, I needed to change. I start doing Pilates and my god did it help. Instantly all the fat I had on my body disappeared. I could run again, I could walk again!Now comes the best part of the movie. When the marvel legend himself says \"it's morbin time\" I couldn't hold it in anymore. Almost like a river, tears flowed out uncontrollably. Tears of sadness? No. Tears of regret? No. They were tears of joy. I was witnessing the best moment of my life.Soon after the movie, I cleaned up my life. I got a job and a girlfriend. I moved out of my parents basement. I now make over 7 figures and I am truly living the best possible life I can. I would like to thank Morbius for saving my life. I don't know where I would be without the film. An absolute masterpiece. 10/10.",

The CGI is unique and eye popping where it exist in the film. The script and story is a good one. It's a basic plot but doesn't overreach and fall short. They understood the assignment and completed the homework and got a good grade. It's old school. Fit everything into 2 hours or less and cover all your bases. There's nothing wrong with the movie in my opinion. I'd argue that a review that gives it a bad score isn't backing that claim with anything substantial. In short, don't shy away from it because of the reviews. It's a must see.",

The theater was way more excited and loud when the iconic EKSE dance appeared on screen than the 3 Spider-Men showing up, that was lame compared to this insta-classic film. I sleep with a DVD copy of this cinematic experience everyday, it helps me morb through the night. When I'm doing exercise, I put the great EKSE song to keep me determined to get the best Morbody a simple mortal like me can have. I'm seriously astonished just how great Sony can be at making movies, for example: The cult classic Emoji Movie. There's no way a human being could thought of that magnificent idea. I loved this film, and I can't wait for Morbius 69. I am also really excited for El Muerto movie, seems it's going to be a great cinematic experience too.",

Though I think \"worst Marvel movie since Josh Trank's Fantastic Four\" is severely exaggerated, considering that film was barely a movie. It's not even the worst Marvel movie in the past five years, but I digress. What I find troubling is the number of critics and potential audience members who've been inclined to trash this movie since it was announced, taking to social media to repeatedly voice their disdain at the very concept of a studio other than Disney making a film about a character they're unfamiliar with.I simply can't place my faith in reviews and opinions from critics or audience members who have spent their months wishing for the film's failure, went into the theater looking for things to hate, handing out half star ratings on Letterboxd while admitted they haven't seen it, and upset that Spider-Man doesn't show up in a movie that's not about him. Yet, that hate is popular. It receives social media engagement, encourages hyperbole and turns film criticism into a game of memes, a competition of who can lay down the sickest burns in an age where we think of almost any form of mass distributed entertainment as \"content,\" rather than something made by people who more often than not care about their work.The language through which we discuss these movies has become rote and stale, their value determined though accuracy to the source material by a majority too unfamiliar with the source to make that kind of call, and too egocentric to admit it.",

    "text": "The concept of Morbius was interesting, but the script was so poorly written and I couldn't get invested in the story. Still, there were many shades of greatness throughout the film and what it could've been. Yet, the execution of it was just so badly handled and the outcome of it was disastrous. Everything was so rushed and unclear. The cast members did their jobs fine and I had no problem with Jared Leto as Michael Morbius. It's just that the writing was awful and I didn't care about any of the characters. The villain of the story, played by Matt Smith, had so much potential but instead we got another cliche movie antagonist and lots of cringeworthy dialogue. I understood his motives and why he does what he does but his character was so undeveloped. Again, it's the script. One aspect of the movie that I thought was handled decently other than the acting was the action sequences. Unlike both Venom movies, you can actually comprehend what's going on and the camerawork was fine. Besides that, I was extremely let down by this film. The dialogue and the writing was just so terrible. The plot was also incredibly dumb and didn't make sense. For example, in one scene that takes place on a bus, a female character takes out a newspaper that clearly states \"Morbius For Wanted\" and Morbius is standing right behind her as he mentions how everyone is on the lookout for him and that no place is safe. And then in the very next scene,....we see them talking publicly at a coffee shop. It's just so stupid. There isn't much of a conclusion to the police sub plot in this movie too. Not to mention, the two post credit scenes. Easily the worst part of this entire film. It is filled with one of the worst dialogues I've ever seen in a Marvel movie and I couldn't help but roll my eyes continuously during each scene. If I say what happened, it would be spoiler. Overall, if you just want to see Morbius in action kicking ass, I think you'll enjoy this film. But from a story perspective, it fails on every level possible.",

However I will keep it short, as it has only been released, and as spoiler free as I can.First of all, despite the bad reviews it has been getting, I found it to be a truly powerful and invoking film to watch. Though, I'm possibly going against the grain on this.My reasoning being, is due to the fact Dr. Michael Morbius is working hard to find treatment for his rare disease, to enhance the quality and expectancy of his life and his brother Milo's.I connected to this film, as it brought up the memories of me fighting hard for many years, with others, to get Vimizim approved by NICE on the NHS.It reminded me of the lengths it drove me to, and others, in this fight. Not that I'm saying that my brother has any Milo like tendencies, but who knows...Yes, it was a film that really spoke to me and I was glued to my chair from start to finish. Though, it may trigger some negative thoughts or imagery for other disabled people.Jared Leto was outstanding in this, but unfortunately I couldn't disassociate Matt Smith from Doctor Who.Anyway, that's all I'll say on this film. Go watch and enjoy the film. Or don't, I don't care what you do. \ud83d\ude09",

    "text": "I say this with as much respect to the Sony team as possible given that they made some truly nostalgic movies during my childhood... but give up the rights to Marvel.This movie pretty much shares the exact same plot as Venom in the sense that yeah the villain is bad but the guy he is fighting is worse. So the theme is sound but what really makes this movie a disaster is the pacing/editing. The dialogue and the scenes all move so fast that there is basically no time to digest the information and it gives the actors as well no time to set the mood for the scene or to build upon it. If the actors aren't talking there's loud music playing and there's no in between. The effects are sub par, the acting is there but somehow seems superficial, and the score is not quite great.I called this review rock bottom, but not the kind of rock bottom where the main character climbs out of the hole and saves the day. More like the kind where the main character just accepts it and then the movie ends depressing. I promise, Kevin Feige wouldn't have let fans get a whiff of this title if he knew it would look this terrible. Sony needs to stop trying to make a quick buck releasing B- movies with the few characters they have, serving them no justice, and stick to the family fun category. Give the fans what they deserve.",

The only thing that sucked was how they tied in vulture and some obvious scenes from the trailer that wasn't featured in the film. Leto did well with playing Michael Morbius. The action and CGI displayed was pretty cool. Again trying to understand what's not liked about the movie other than the lack of blood which doesn't earn it a low score. We can use common sense and understand why the blood wasn't heavily featured. Go see Morbius. I love vampire movies.",

The second half though unfortuantly is where it really fell down and to the point I could have walked out. Matt Smith's performance is horrendous and cringy and had moments that felt as bad as \"Emo Peter Parker\" from Spider-Man 3 about his performance.This film is an easy pass aed even the end credit scene only added to the dissapointment but the acting is up there with the worst. I am genuinely worried what direction Sony is going in and going to Milk DInseys sucess and need to leave it to them in my opinion.",

Suddenly he's on different places without any scene construction.Zero emotion towards the movie too.Big reason that it breaks for me is that no one gives a s**t about his condition as it was NORMAL having a vampire out there (that just got supernatural powers by combining DNA with a normal bat, I mean, what?).The guy jumps ultra heights and the officers doesn't even go \"WHOA\". They don't even put a surprised face! It's like: oh boy, that guy can jump.And later they are face to face and one guy brings holy water as if that situation is super normal.If you don't expect anything and just wanna kill time, you can watch it once, but too bad people wasted money with it.But, overall, they really give no interest to people so they feel like knowing the character Morbius. (I never heard of him before, and if depends on this movie, will never want to.)",

I genuinely couldn't gauge what emotion I was supposed to feel during any given scene and there wasn't even one minute of the film that was interesting. Also, the curse that this film gave me is that I can't refrain from combining Morbius into my words. My brain has been morbed, and I once shed a tear thinking of the word Morbiussy.

This means that movies that go against the grain and don't include one of each ethnicity,gender and race are just dismissed. Not to say this an amazing movie, but it's certainly an entertaining one. It's as close to DC style darkness that you will probably ever see a Marvel movie be. I found Jared's portrayal of Morbius and his internal struggle quite compelling. I think if this was released with a mature rating it would have just been a gorefest, and missed the point of Morbius anti hero struggle. Definitely enjoyed it a lot more than the Dr Strange sequel and the Batman reboot. Certainly doesn't deserve the hate it gets.",

There was characters, a hero and a villain, the movie was recorded, there was a scrip and action, I don't know how they did it! There was so markables scenes like when Dr. Michael confirmed \"It's Morbin Time\", or when he says \"this is some kind of 'Morbius' from 2022?\", I morbed all over myself when I saw it. With all this, I can say that \"Morbius\" was truly one of the movies ever made.",

Now, it doesn't feel very marvel-esc but I like that about it. As a movie it just works, the setting and pacing is perfect for it and again the actors really do a great job.No forced inclusivity or political messaging and just focus on delivering the story feels like something out of the ordinary nowadays. It's sad that that is gonna be one of the points that makes me have deeper immersion but that's how it is. First movie in a while I really got in to.",

I hope they gonna do a very good sequel, I love marvel and they never disappointed. Will see, but the move wasnt't very bad, maybe it's not for everyone, it's a sf movie, not dramatic or romantic.",

Watched it again with his son the following night and well there was more of the movie during the credits. So watch the ENTIRE thing or you wil miss an important ending!!!!",

No but I still liked the movie. It was a good story, I thought it was told well and the pacing was decent. I was caught off guard with the bad guy and I enjoyed that. I hate when I can see the conflict in the first 5 minutes of the movie.Is Morbius a Spider-Man No Way Home? Heck no but it's on par with Venom. To be truthful I like Venom but that's because I think Tom Hardy is a much better actor.Could Morbius 2 be better? Definitely if they pick a better villain, give Leto a better script, and maybe some acting classes.Go in with an open mind and be open to enjoying the movie.",

    "text": "I had the benefit of watching this film terrified that it would be as shambolic as 2015s Fantastic 4 or Doolittle. As a result, I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed it. It is an average super hero film, but I've seen average super hero films that haven't received near as much hate. I'd put this on par with Thor 2, personally.The story starts with a good setup. I found Morbius himself to be very endearing. He's an understated, brilliant doctor suffering from a chronic disease that will eventually kill him. He has dedicated his life to finding a cure, not just for himself but others and is really the ideal reluctant monster when all goes south. His friend Milo, also very enjoyable, suffers the same illness. He hasn't been dealt quite as good a hand and lacks Morbius's resilience and compassion but the two are very close and I thought there was some good chemistry between them.Morbius has a pretty simple plot that would be difficult to really ruin. Unfortunately, I don't think it's creators made the best use of it's simplicity. It lacked emotional impact which could have been built up by simply sitting in the moment a bit longer in some places. Instead, it jumps from scene to scene and sometimes failed to follow through with ideas that had been introduced.I would have liked to have seen a more endearing love interest in the character of Martine. I think we're past the days where 'hot' was an acceptable alternative to personality in female characters. If Martine had been a little quirkier and funner she would have been really complimentary to Morbius's calmer, gentle demeanour. As it was the relationship wasn't one I really cared about which let down the movie. There is also a very important decision that Morbius didn't struggle with enough and again, the film lacked emotional impact as a result.All in all, not a compelling film, but fine for a quiet Friday night. I look forward to seeing Morbius again in his world of Marvel villains, hopefully under the guidance of a director who can pull a bit more out of Leto.",
