        "text": "Assassin John Wick is referred to as Baba Yaga in this third chapter, suggesting that he is, in fact, a supernatural being; his ability to evade death, appear and disappear like a ninja from a Godfrey Ho film, and move with lightning fast reflexes despite being in his mid-fifties confirms this fact, in my opinion. Unfortunately, Wick's invincibility means that the many action scenes in Parabellum are largely devoid of excitement, the only outcome being that Wick is still alive and all of his enemies are dead.Chapter 2 set things up for a potentially entertaining part three, ending with John Wick (Keanu Reeves) on the run, hunted by the world's top assassins, all keen to collect the bounty on his head. This film should have been a whole lot of outrageously OTT comic-book fun, with an array of bizarre and unique killers, each with their own distinctive look and style; it certainly starts off on the right foot with a few of fun fight scenes (one against a tall guy in a library, another in a shop full of knives, and one in a stable that makes good use of the horses), but it all goes downhill rapidly after that.A pack of trained dogs easily outshine their human co-stars in one skirmish, a fight involving samurai swords and motorbikes blatantly borrows from The Villainess (2017), and a battle between Wick and Mark Dacascos in a glass room is frustratingly tedious (despite Dacascos's impressive martial arts skills). I blame director Chad Stahelski, who hasn't progressed as a film-maker since part one, content to simply give fans more of the same. The preposterous ending is the icing on the cake, John Wick surviving falling several stories from the roof of a building. Enough already!5/10, minus one point for the retro-technology used by the tattooed administrators working for the 'high table': Commodore 64 keyboards, green CRT monitors, rubber stamps, rotary dial phones. Seriously, what is the point?",

        "text": "In the immediate lineage of the second opus, this new one should satisfy all the fans of the John Wick saga (I'm definitely one of them!) which can be considered as a huge video game, a kind of God of War (2005), with the audience within the movie theater as gamers. You may choose John Wick as Player 1 with an immortal cheat code or any other opponent as Player 2 without this cheat code. Although this new opus innovates with new weapons like horses, dogs, katanas and new horizons with Morocco, the recipe is, to put it simply, almost identical and always successful.I especially enjoyed the tribute to the legendary film Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo (1966) with the famous scene during which Tuco, a.k.a. The Ugly, elaborates a custom-made weapon by combining pieces from Remington, Colt, Smith & Wesson, ... and acoustically checks that the result lives up to his expectations, carefully listening to the sound of the barrel. Not to mention an unexpected reference to The Matrix (1999) via the quote « Guns, lots of guns! »But... one of the keys of a cinematographic success is a villain being up to the hero. In the first opus, Viggo Tarasov was of a rather imposing stature, i.e. the leader of the Russian underworld in New York, and interpreted by a charismatic and credible actor, Michael Nyqvist. In the second opus, Santino D'Antonio was an abject, perfidious and megalomaniac man which sees himself as the only representative of the Camorra with the ambition to sit on the High Table, whatever it takes. In this regard, Riccardo Scamarcio was awesome. In the third and last opus, it's almost a fiasco. Firstly, we do not really know who the big boss is. Secondly, there are a plethora of ridiculous underlings. The Adjudicator is an uptight and condescending woman (we almost want to give her slaps). Then Berrada is a wreck who shoots an innocuous dog without being able to kill it (my 5-year-old nephew would probably succeed, even with a water pistol). And finally, the Elder is a guy who drinks mint tea in the middle of the desert, surrounded by his dromedaries (no comment). Beyond this mess, Zero tries to save the day. In short, the villains are ultra-quantitative but insufficiently qualitative! We definitely need a Thanos, a T-1000, a Predator, ... figuratively speaking.As a synthesis: yyeeeeeesssss! And my evening of Wednesday, May 19, 2021 is already booked, no matter what.",

We learn more about the High Table as their Adjudicator seeks to sanction those who have helped Wick: meanwhile Wick battles his way through the many, many, many, many anonymous figures who seek to kill him.Keanu Reeves kicks off Chpater 3 exactly where Chaper 2 left off, racing his pigeon-toed way through the streets of New York not quite ahead of the entire population, all of whom seem to know who he is as they wait, heavily armed, on the next corner.I liked John Wick 1. I thought number 2 was empty nonsense, non-stop videogame violence in search of a story. And, regrettably, number 3 is more of the same. I've scrolled through IMDB comments, through masses of 9s and 10s all declaring this to be the best yet, and how much better it is than anything else in cinemas at the moment. OK, fair enough, opinions are like fundamental orifices, everyone's got one, and what comes out of them is the same for each of us.But to me, the reason why this film fails (not completely, there was at least a little bit of story about the nature of the High Table) is because none of the exquisitely choreographed slaughter means anything. There are several reasons for this:\n1. You can't hurt Wick. Stab him, run him over, throw him off a building - he just stands up, groans a bit, and carries on;\n2. The number and manner of combatants is unbelievable. Wherever he is, there is an endless procession of assailants waiting to take their places in the queue of imminent corpses, usually 2 at a time. Pop, pop, another 2.\n3. Assailants all have patented guaranteed to miss ammunition, Wick has patented guaranteed to hit ammunition. Yeah, right.\n4. Knowing that you can't hurt him and he can kill you means that there is nothing at stake when he fights you - the result is predetermined.\n5. The assailants are all faceless, anonymous bodies. They are not people, they are simply outlines in fairground tatget practice. There is no emotional significance to taking a life. These are not people, so who cares?Regrettably - because I like Keanu Reeves, this is empty-headed style over substance. No 9 or 10 from me, I'm afraid.",

Anyway, I don't know where these people are coming from that call the movie exciting, non-stop, incredible, OMG, etc. To be clear, I loved the first John Wick. The second one to me was eh because it got really silly with the whole \"high table\" and medallions and basically everyone in the world is a contract killer, etc. John Wick 3 is basically the second one, only on PCP.The entire 3rd film is literally like watching someone play a video game with god mode on. Nothing stops him. He gets stabbed in the neck, that's ok. Stitch it up, move on. People fire hundreds of rounds at him. It's ok, they all missed. He gets hit with two cars literally back to back. He just gets up. Hell, he gets shot point blank 5/6 times and falls out of a 4th or 5th story balcony, bounces off of everything and splats on the street, it's ok, he's still alive and just \"angry\" now. The entire movie is just and endless line of contract killers coming up to Wick and them fighting.Don't get me wrong, I love action movies and like I said, I loved the first one. Without a good story though, it's just silly. After about 45/50 minutes, you literally start shaking your head because it just becomes really repetitive. A friend of mine asked me how the movie was afterward. It can be summed up as \"everyone goes after Wick, everyone dies, the end.\" The movie is also left wide open for a sequel which just blew my mind. Just stop. The movie was the equivalent of someone who was playing GTA3 their first time, just running around and shooting and killing everything that moves.",

In fact, this may just pip that one to the post to be the best JOHN WICK yet. The pacing is spot on and the plotting is measured by a huge amount of action sequences, all of which fizz and crackle with skill and energy. The movie hits the ground running as Keanu faces off with a hulking character in a library and then Triads in a weapon shop, but what really amazes here is the sheer inventiveness of the non-repetitive action. There are horse and motorbike chases, a Moroccan brawl with fighting dogs, alongside the massive action of the climax. There also seems to be a greater emphasis on hand-to-hand combat, featuring the likes of RAID actors and old-timer Mark Dacascos, which is a real pleasure as the choreography is top-notch. In terms of sheer enjoyment, this is a film hard to beat, and to criticise it at all is unnecessary. Bring on the fourth!",

The producers of John Wick, with both eyes clearly on building a profitable franchise, have decided to do a Mission Impossible with The Syndicate and 007 with Spectre, and create a super organisation - The High Table. And with it (roll eyes moment) rules, regulations, protocol etc which are all becoming too often and too much these days.What this means is, we get an all out action-packed opening of 20-odd minutes before the show becomes a platform for product placements and poorly choreographed fight scenes where you can see Keanu 'acting' more than fighting and in fact, struggling to keep up (and not because he is injured or has been thrown about). The fight scenes, many shot wide angle, do not have the energy and intensity of the opening sequences and there are many, many moments where you feel 'oh come on, John's whole body is open for attack'. Laurence Fishburn, Angelica Houston and Halle Berry are wasted and don't even get me started on Asia Kate Dillon - she is annoying in Billions, even more so here. I am a big fan of the first John Wick, was ho-hum about the sequel but this third one, haiz...can't say I'm looking forward to a 4th instalment. There may be a High Table but there's nothing inviting on it.",

There is not much of a story, except for Wick's trading on on past favors with ever-higher-ranking bad guys, and at each level having to kill a few dozen more baddies. There was virtually no humor or personal interest in Wick himself.Question: how do supposedly brilliant crime bosses manage to hire only underlings who cannot shoot or fight well enough to take out one injured, exhausted man? With all of them spraying machine gun bullets in Wick's direction, how come he never gets hit? Jeez, I'd even settle for a richochet.Best wishes to viewers who like that sort of thing, but I found it horribly boring and walked out about 2/3's of the way thru the film.

It was a great escape movie, violence with a plot. John Wick 2 was less successful for me, lots of violence, no plot. The best parts were minor ones, John and Santino's sister before she dies and John's professional courtesy to Common. In John Wick 3 I guess you could say there was a plot, but mostly there was stylized violence which just got boring. It would have been nice to have more plot concerning the workings of the High Table and a better adjudicator. This actress was a little boring. There is no doubt as I stated earlier the casting was great, Angelica Houston was a great addition. Finally meeting the head of the high table was also great but in total the movie was average.",

        "text": "PROS: Nice action for most part, although having John Wick killing everybody for 2 hours leads to some repetitive death/fight patterns and yawns. Very good photography and some cool visuals.CONS: No script whatsoever, almost no dialogue (and when there is some it seems like a 7 year old Stallone wrote it, plus almost all lines are delivered badly by the cast). Makes zero sense (they had so many chances to kill off john wick but left him alive only so that wick could kill them instead) . Has no plot! Just fights and fights. Should end sooner, can't make a two hour movie with kicks and shoots only. I regretted buying a ticket for this.",

When there's action, we should be engaged. Problem is, this action spoiled the bed. What is there to see after you watch John Wick shove a knife into a guy's eyeball? Especially after he breaks a guy's jaw and neck with a book? They blew their load too early and the movie became repetitive and gratuitous.\nThe sets looked good, the lighting was awesome, the choreography was well executed, and the other people seemed to have fun. I didn't and that sucks.",

Unexpectedly continued the story in an interesting way. It expanded the whole \"assassin's underworld\" - they're every second person in NY - to ridiculous levels, but it was still pretty good. The plot didn't really get in the way of all the action.John Wick 3 - bloody hell. Why? Why?! What were they thinking?So yea, it continues the story, but in the most boneheaded way possible. John Wick is running - okay, cool. He has a marker?! Wow! I wonder if he'll use it to do something cool - no, he doesn't.The High Table sends an adjudicator and punishes those who assisted John? I wonder if they'll fight back - no, they don't.John Wick instead goes to the desert (where apparently - \"the Elder\" - the mysterious leader of the literally millions of assassins lives like some quasi-Egyptian/Arab Bedouin nomad king - does he have an internet connection out there?) and literally cuts his finger off to get a second chance to rejoin the assassin fraternity. Then when the characters he's sent to kill says \"Hey, don't kill me. Fight against the High Table\", John Wick says, \"Oh yeah, great idea.\" While he's standing there with his finger cut off... #$%& me - how stupid can they make this story?Like, literally, what the hell? The script is so completely retarded. It wrecks the whole film. It's all pointless - maybe that was the director's point?John Wick 2 set the film up so well, and #3 just sh#ts all over it. Absolutely hated it. 0 out of 10, but I gave it 2 in the hopes that they fire the director and hire better writers for #4.",

        "text": "The first film was a surprise box office hit, and naturally a sequel followed, which ended on a cliffhanger, I saw them both on DVD or online, this was going to be the first of the films I would see in the cinema, and I looked forward to it. Basically set an hour after the conclusion of the previous film, former hitman John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is now a marked man on the run in New York, he has been given one hour \"grace period\". After killing a crime lord of the High Table Santino D'Antonio, doing so unsanctioned in the New York City Continental, John has been declared \"excommunicado\", the bounty on his head stands at $14 million. Following the activation of the bounty, John reaches the New York Public Library and recovers a crucifix necklace and a \"marker\" medallion from cache hidden in a book. He fights his way through various assassins populating the city, until he reaches the Director (Anjelica Huston), a woman from his past, who accepts the crucifix as a \"ticket\" for safe passage to Casablanca, Morocco. The Director also brands Wick to signify that he has used up all his favours with her. Meanwhile, the Adjudicator (Asia Kate Dillon) meets with Winston (Ian McShane), the manager of the New York City Continental, and the Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne), the leader of a network of assassins. The adjudicator admonishes both for helping John Wick kill Santino D'Antonio, they are both are given seven days to give up their offices or face serious consequences. In Casablanca, John meets Sofia (Halle Berry), a former friend and the manager of the Casablanca Continental. He presents his marker and asks Sofia to honour it by helping him get to The Elder (Saïd Taghmaoui), a high-ranking member of the High Table, so that he can get the bounty relinquished. Sofia takes him to assassin Berrada (Jerome Flynn), who tells John that he will find the Elder by wandering through the desert until he cannot walk any longer. Berrada asks for one of Sofia's dogs in exchange for this information, she refuses, he shoots the dog (it survives with a bullet proof jacket). In rage, Sofia shoots Berrada, she and John fight their way through the various henchmen, until they escape the casbah and flee into the desert. Having fulfilled her marker, Sofia leaves John in the desert, he roams until he collapses from exhaustion. He is found by The Elder's men, and meeting the man himself, John explains his actions, saying he is desperate to live and \"earn\" the memory of the love he had with his wife. The Elder agrees to forgive John, only if he assassinates Winston and works for the High Table until his death. To show his commitment, John severs his ring finger and gives his wedding ring to The Elder. Meanwhile, the adjudicator has recruited the assassin Zero (Mark Dacascos) and his \"students\" to find and kill John. With Zero's help, the Director and the Bowery King are accosted for their actions, both are maimed as penance, the Bowery King almost fatally. John arrives back in New York City and is pursued by Zero's men but reaches the Continental and takes sanctuary. Winston encourages John not to die as a killer but as a man who loved and was loved by his wife. The adjudicator arrives, but Winston refuses to give up his office, and John refuses to kill Winston. Consequently, the adjudicator \"deconsecrates\" the Continental, allowing killing in the building. Zero and his men are notified by the adjudicator, two busloads of body-armoured High Table enforcers arrive. With the help of the hotel's concierge, Charon (Lance Reddick), John defends the Continental from the enforcers, killing them with armour-piercing shotgun shells. John is then ambushed by Zero and his \"students\", he defeats and kills all but two of the \"students\", then kills Zero. The adjudicator negotiates in a discussion with Winston, he offers penance to the High Table. John arrives, the adjudicator identifies him as a threat to the negotiation, so Winston shoots John repeatedly, causing John to fall from the Continental's roof. The Continental returns to operation, but the adjudicator informs Winston that John's body has disappeared and that he remains a threat to them. A wounded John Wick is taken to the heavily scarred Bowery King, who is angry with the High Table and will be fighting against them, John agrees to join him. Also starring Jason Mantzoukas as Tick Tock Man, Randall Duk Kim as Doctor and Gotham's Robin Lord Taylor as Administrator. Reeves remains cool and focused as the former assassin that will not be messed with, the revenge element has disappeared, the antihero is simply fighting for survival, it does not feel quite as fresh as before, the fights are well choreographed, but a little repetitive, but the escalating body count, over-the-top deaths and violence still just about work, it is still a worthwhile action thriller sequel.

Something that didn't go quite well and that was the ending. When John wick got shot, fell down the building and went underground with Bowery king. It was kind of a disappointing ending. It felt like John wick ended up in the same place he was in the beginning of the movie, but now full of rage. I just don't think this was the way to end it. Of course the movie ended that way to give the audience high hopes for the next chapter but still. Way end a movie the same way it started more or less???. For me, that was the only flaw.

Keanu is on the run after being declared excommunicado for killing a member of the International Assassin's Guild on sacred protected ground-Ian's hotel-and he was given a one hour head start before the dogs are let loose. A $14 million dollar bounty is put on his head and anyone that helps him would be in trouble too, so almost everybody wants a piece of him. Halle plays an old friend of Keanu's-he helped her once before and she owes him a favor so he is wanting to collect it. Asia plays the Adjudicator-she enforces the rules and has hired help to make sure things run smoothly. Mark is one of those hired help. The fights are incredible. And I mean all kinds of fights; martial arts, guns, motorcycles....even horseback. For you sports fans, Keanu has a fight with NBA player Boban Marjanovic-he is 7 foot 3 inches tall-and it is amazing. FYI: Parabellum has two meanings. First, it is Latin for Prepare For War. Second, it is the name of a 9mm handgun cartridge. I have heard that this will be the last one in the John Wick series but it ends with a set up for #4-I don't know, I guess we will just have to wait and see. This one is definitely the best of the three.\nIt's rated \"R\" for strong violence and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 10 minutes.\nI loved this adrenaline rush and I can't wait to buy it on Blu-Ray.",

Think of those horror films which don't amount to anything more than 1001 different ways to kill someone as gruesomely as possible. After a while it just became tedious, with a few over the top moments for the sadists in our midst - do we really need to see a knife slowly being forced into and through a person's eye and into their brain (with no more motive to hate the guy than him being one of the multitude of assassins trying to kill the hero)? As for the imperviousness of the hero, it's no good showing him being stabbed, shot and beaten up if the result is that he just keeps going and never gets hit by a bullet from someone (multiple supposedly highly trained assassins) simply standing back and taking him out. Instead they all dutifully cue up to have a go at him, with one arm, then the other, then a foot...\nThe film's effort to portray some kind of code of honour was also absurd, given the flexibility that saw it all boiled down to 'kill or be killed'.\nHalle Berry gives us the only decent scene, when she goes into full warrior mode because a guy ruthlessly killed her dog (tho' we later see both dogs in action during the escape - evidently it was as bullet-proof as the hero). If there has to be a JW4 - and everything was set up for yet another sequel - at least bring her back to lend a bit of class to the proceedings.",

        "text": "John Wick: Chapter 3 ParabellumSo the easiest way to sum up JW3 is that if like me you enjoyed the first two instalments then this third outing for Baba Yaga will be right up your street.\nThe plot is thin and simple.\nJohn is on the run from every hitman and assassin on the planet and he must come up with some rather creative ways in which to stay alive.JW3 is a masterclass in action movie making.\nI truly believe stuntmen and women should get Oscars.\nThe work gone into making this sequel is groundbreaking in terms of practical stunts and effects.\nThere also should be a category for best performance in an action role. In which Keanu Reeves would win hands down.\nIn my review for JW2 I said the film left me fatigued with too much repetition.\nOnly after buying the Blu-ray of that movie did I truly appreciate it.\nJW3 on the other hand isn't repetitive in terms of the action sequences.\nThere's some real creativity gone into developing every action scene.\nInventive and impressive are words that can be used to describe each set piece.\nThe opening fight sequence involving a rather tall gentleman and a book sets the tone.\nThen we are treated to knife fights. Fights on horseback, Fights on motorcycles,Fights with guns. Lots of guns!\nOh and there's Halle Berry's attack dogs which are awesome!\nSpeaking of Miss Berry. She's fantastic and really sells her action scenes.\nSadly though she's a little under-utilised. Her part isn't as big as the trailers would have you believe.\nThere's strong support from 90's straight to video star Mark Dacascos.\nIt was nice to see him again. He's an accomplished martial artist who never really got the recognition he deserved during his heyday.JW3 is going to be a fine looking movie when it makes its way on to 4K Blu-ray. I believe the HDR in this film will look sublime.\nThe film projected well in the theatre and often cinema screens can look a tad murky.\nIn terms of sound design this film sounded amazing.\nThe final shoot out was truly spectacular.\nEach different gun having its own signature sound.\nBass was really punchy.\nEvery punch, kick and cracking bone could be heard to earsplitting effect.In terms of plot and storytelling this is where the film stumbles a little. My score for this movie kept fluctuating due to the convoluted plot.\nI think the scriptwriters have tried to build a franchise out of the first films simple premise and it is always apparent that it seems forced.\nA minor gripe because in terms of the action genre all the John Wick movies must be regarded as all time greats.\nThe JW franchise will become classics of the genre unlike the tripe certain over the hill action stars churn out. (I'll name no names but a fat guy with a goatee and a ponytail springs to mind).\nJW will be a classic because they're inventive, well shot and expertly made.\nEvery punch, kick and shot to the head can be seen.\nThere's no shaky-cam. No choppy editing hiding the fact that the actors can't do the business.\nThe audience are treated to a visual chaotic feast of violence.\nIf indeed this type of thing is up your street then JW3 is going to be one for your Blu-ray collection.\nA film that if judged solely on its action set pieces then it's the best of the three.\nHowever overall as a movie we the audience aren't emotionally connected to JW3 as we were with the first film.\nIt has a over convoluted plot that expands on the second films flaws.\nStill I'm up for John Wick: Chapter 4, I'll be there opening night.",

The character's motivations were relatable and the action was clever and often original.\nThe sequels have both been huge disappointments, seemingly made by people with only a passing knowledge of the first movie.\nIn John Wick it's established that he is a master assassin able to slip in and out without detection. A ghost. It also establishes he is a stickler for the rules.\nJohn Wick 2 kicks off with John doing something he doesn't want to do becasue someone takes advantage of his respect for the rules. Not only does the movie later contradict that respect, but his execution of the contract is incredibly sloppy, walking directly through the party so everyone can recognize him.\nThis movie is ridiculous. They've turned John into a superhuman who can survive stabbings, gun shots, punches, and falling off a tall building while hitting every obstacle possible on the way down. Worse, it's also mean-spirited and incredibly repetitive, devolving into a tiresome exercise in \"How can we kill the next guy creatively?\". How am I supposed to root for a guy who broke the rules and ends up murdering dozens of people who are faithfully attempting to collect on a legitimate contract? The Adjudicator wasn't the antagonist here nor were any of the other assassins. John Wick is the antagonist.",

A very big wealthy organization who run a huge international gangster group couldn't hire someone with a sniper to kill one man. A man is hit by car twice and then he gets up and kill them all.

        "text": "I will start this off by saying that I did enjoy the first film and sure, the second movie wasn't for me, I get why people could enjoy it. But with this third installment? Firstly, this movie is about an hour and 50 minutes of action scenes in which yes, we get some admittedly good action scenes here and there, but quickly, it gets dull. Be it from watching the many assassins go after John Wick (who also gets about 6 lines the whole movie so yay.) in similar manner to the last film, to shootouts with Halle Berry and genital hungry dogs (its cool the first couple of times but seeing it back to back for nearly 10 minutes makes the sight lose any impact and luster) that last just far too long. Also, the action gets absurdly comical (not just with the dogs, but also with horses kicking people to death) and hey, that's cool in a Fast and Furious film because they know that they are big dumb action movies, but this film series was trying to be something smarter, something deeper, but evidently that is no longer the case especially if you pay attention to what little dialogue is here. This movie really wants to pretend that it is saying something profound, or the characters are doing anything that isn't obviously evil (Ian McShane is doing something duplicitous? Perish the thought!) but instead, it comes off like a 12 year old wrote this movie. Also, this world is beginning to make less and less sense the more the attempt to add to it, and the more they add to John Wick's backstory (hey, he's Belorussian! Does this matter? No.) it makes it feel like they are making things up as they go to try and justify having John Wick be Superman without the ability to fly. Look, I love action but by this point in the series, its hard to care about what is happening or feel like this movie isn't simply spinning its wheels in terms of actual story telling or meaningful action that can actual excite. I fully expect the next movie to have John Wick have a fistfight on top of a plane with three shark ninjas who stole his wife's body who is actually still alive and trying to destroy the world with a techno-organic computer virus. This movie is that stupid.",

John Wick 3, however, to borrow the Spinal Tap meme \"Turns it up to 11\". But not in a good way.The action is too prolonged at every turn. Gone is the John Wick of the first movie - an efficient, ruthless killer, that despatches his victims quickly and without fuss. Here is the John Wick that ignores openings for killing blows, takes far too long over fights and seems himself to be tired of it all.Not, I stress, an aging, battered Wick that is slowing down and past his prime. That might have been interesting. No, this is a John Wick hampered by a script with too little plot and which has had scrawled over it with great liberalness the phrase \"Insert pointless action scene here\".Gone is \"Mindless, enjoyable action\" and hello to \"Mindless, tiresome action\".Now, having said the action is, essentially, boring, that is not to say it isn't well done. But it is a little too slapstick, with far too many people being thrown through far too many windows. Fights go on endlessly with none of the protagonists really showing any signs of fatigue, or really suffering any ill-effects from any wounds/injuries suffered until the killing blow.It's as if Michael Bay directed it, shouting \"More shattering windows!\" and \"Keep going! More fighting!\" all the time.What little plot there is could have been neatly packaged into about sixty minutes including action scenes (that were not dragged out).In addition, there was a strange lack of attention to detail in some scenes. People are murdered in a subway in front of hundreds of witnesses whom all fail to react in any way. Said bodies then disappear from one shot to the next. In some scenes, blood is spattered about liberally, whilst in others any amount of sword and stabbing action draws no obvious blood-letting. There is a risible amount of knife-throwing in one scene, which was beyond ridiculous, with blades going back and forth and seemingly not having much effect when they struck home. All in all, each and every fight sequence was just too long and too tedious.I can't, in all honesty, recommend this, even if you enjoyed the first two Wick movies. What's worse, it leaves the opening at the end to vomit up another installment. I only hope if they do regurgitate another one, that they actually get someone competent in to write an actual script, rather than whoever was responsible for this mess.SUMMARY: John Wick... finally gets on your wick. Dull fight scenes go on longer than War and Peace. Be afraid, be very afraid... of an extended edition.",

Its psychedelic cinematography and mise en scene is what makes this franchise stand out from other action films, and it also cements Reeves as one of the most iconic screen presences there is working in cinema today.He says very little in the film, but action speaks louder than words, and my goodness, what sublime action there is in this beautiful film.Picking up straight from JW2, Parabellum is an almost exhausting exercise in action, and you have to empathise with Wick, he rarely has a chance to rest during the film, and the physical and psychological damage he suffers only adds to the films tension.Part 3 ups the ante with the set pieces, from the small intimate ones in a library, to the grand extended almost balletic extended shootouts in the second and third act, John Wick never fails to amaze the viewer, but with all this action, when we stop to breathe, especially when we have exposition starring Berry and Huston, the film really does stop in a jarring way.Camerawork is wonderful, particularly when we are on the road, with the camera focusing on the long road, subliminally referencing Wicks never ending journey, just when will it all be over? How will this man ever rest? Will Wick ever get to the end of his journey, his goal to carry on living, so he can remember?It's also great to see Dacascos starring in a major release again, his Zero is a formidable adversary, but his strange, almost camp like ways make him a very likeable presence, causing the viewer to let their guard down, and endear to him, making him one of the most dangerous villains.It's a wonderfully crafted film, almost dreamlike in its nature, the desert scene is awe-inspiring and a genuine jaw dropping moment, that lets you almost feel the delusional state Wick must be feeling as he slowly dehydrates.It's also very funny in places, with Macshane providing the biggest laugh by simply putting a phone down.So all in all, it's a wonderful sequel, thanks to Reeves hypnotic presence, the amazing choreography, and some wonderful camerawork.One cannot wait to see how the next film will top this.",

How many times can you see John break someone's hand, throw them to the ground and shoot them in the head before you get tired of seeing it?Later on in the movie, I swear the fight scenes look slow, and the hits feel like they have no force behind it. You stop being worried for John, because he shrugs a hit off every minute. You know what I started thinking of while watching this movie? Cartoons and old Chinese kung-fu movies where every attack is telegraphed a week in advance. The movie has officially abandoned the \"secret society of assassins\" theme they were going for. In multiple scenes, people are killed in public, and no one in a crowded place reacts. The fight scenes with the dogs, arguably the best scenes, look incredibly fake. When people stop moving for the dogs to attack them, it just starts looking comical. It's cool, but you never buy it.John Wick 3 wasted a perfectly good actor, Keanu, to keep on increasing the senseless kill count. It's not impressive anymore.The whole 2nd and 3rd act was nullified by the ending.John wants to continue living and looks for a chance to be forgiven. When you make us watch John spend an hour of the movie looking for someone, find him, get what he wants, only to throw that away in the next 5 minutes, it feels like a bad plot.When you make us watch Halle tell John multiple times that helping him is dangerous for her safety, and that one mistake can get her killed, start killing people of the organization while she could have walked away, only for a dog killing punchline, it starts looking like a bad plot.When you make us watch Winston refuse to step down, refuse to kill John, arm John, and then shoot John after some senseless killing, which he could have done just as well when John came to the glass room and turned his back to Winston, it feels like a bad plot.That scene where John falls from the roof of a building to the ground, and survives, they might as well have given him superpowers.I started wanting for it to end, because I felt I have seen enough of this franchise, only to be very disappointed by the sequel bait. They are becoming the new Terminator. It should have ended on the second, but we will get 3 more.",

I mean killing a giant with a book and having a horse kick two of the guys is insane!\nI love how we are slowly getting more background on who John Wick is (like his real name).\nMy only flak on this movie is how the bad guys keep letting John get away. When John was escaping on the horse, the bad guys on the motorcycle was riding alongside him but insist on using a sword to kill him only to have John steal their gun and shoot all of them. They could've just unloaded on him.\nOverall, this was a great action packed movie with beautiful cinematography and of course the fighting and shooting scenes were great as always. I was sure that is would be the final movie in the series but with that ending, there needs to be more.",

It doesn't make any sense to follow all the codes if you can challenge it. The adjudicator placed a 7-day notice before executing penalties and giving people options, that feels weird, because John Wick story before this is all about the immediate and clear consequence. If you do this, you'll get that.Parabellum expanded the Wick's World to the East, which opens a very interesting possibilities to play with. However, it struggles to make it natural. Kill Bill has set the bar for western fighting movies very high, making Parabellum fight scenes with the Asians assains look like Fast and Fury.The fight scenes also showed a classic problem that has been solved long ago, and can be seen in so many Jacky Chan's movies, Matrix series even has solved this too. People don't brawl in order, one enemy by one enemy, the come altogether towards the target.I can appreciate the addition of some new characters. Not all of them are strong. Halle Berry and Anjelica Houston are strong ones. And especially the fighting DOGS!!! The not-so-Japanese Japanese character, played by Marc Dacascos, is weak.I hope the next sequel can compensate this one. 6/10 for this lazy sequel.",

        "text": "John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is the newest action-comedy from the Matrix stunt coordinator Chad Stahelski. The movie is starring Neo, Morpheus and the Keymaker from the Matrix, Morticia Addams from the Addams Family and Professor Trevor 'Broom' Bruttenholm from Hellboy. And you thought John Wick 2 was getting silly.The script is a mess of random actions and occurrences that don't lead to anything, really. This had to be an inside joke since they emphasize the word \"consequences\" multiple times in this film. The story just writes itself where it needs to be. Lots of different locations and racial stereotyping are just there for color, not connected to anything. The movie sometimes spills out half-baked philosophy or random Latin adage with a straight face, thinking that it is in fact - very smart.John Wick has even less character in this. I have no idea what he is supposed to be at this point in the franchise. They give some vague hints on his past, giving him a silly-sounding name and a Belarussian childhood or something (which was hilarious since I live in Ukraine, near Belarus). Throughout the movie, JW has like 10-20 lines of dialogue. He never does anything besides killing people violently and his moral choices make no sense. He takes an oath only to immediately abandon it, making the first hour of the movie essentially pointless. But this doesn't mean anything anyway since the ending fixes itself. And as it turns out, nobody really cared about John Wick in the first place. This may sound like a joke, but in fact, the development he has received in the first film is all we get for this trilogy.Judging the movie as a full experience is not that easy though. It has some good professional stuns (yet if you pay close attention you can spot some clues and pauses in the fight scenes, like someone waiting for his part and more). While I do prefer The Raid brawls to John Wick ones, I can appreciate the absence of shaky cam, actual long takes, and good visibility during the fights in JW3. The shooting parts were mostly ok, nothing that creative though. I loved some of the new ideas they've used, like adding dogs to the mix. There are some very good scenes with a decent flow of action. Action-wise, my only problem was that it was sort of becoming a little boring as the movie went on. I think this happened because JW himself is boring and immortal, you can never care about him since you know nothing bad can happen to him. Bike chases, horse chases, yea, this was getting a little repeatable. This could've worked better if they would've used real blanks instead of CGI blood and muzzle flashes. I was also surprised to see Mark Dacascos in good shape. He did some good stunts as well at his age. His character is trash, though.So, by the time I was getting tired of the action pieces I had nothing to grab on. Nothing to interest me in this film besides stupidity and low level misplaced humor. Everybody just became straight out of video-game characters. We now have enemy waves, NPC crowds that never reacts to people getting killed around them, bullet-sponge enemies, and mission status updates.I got a little confused with the references in this, though. John Wick directly referencing his line in the Matrix \"Guns, lots of guns\", Winston mentions Baba Yaga, a Russian folk-tale character out of the new Hellboy, in which Winston plays Prof. Broom. All these bizarre casting decisions, having Mark Dacascos as a Japanese man...I mean, I don't even know anymore.Overall good stuff in this: nice stuns (yet slowly becoming boring), good cinematography, nice color correction and shots composition (dark red and blue gritty film).Could've been better if they would've made this darker, had less kills, make JW vulnerable, explore his hurt inside, play around gun and assassination philosophy and add more visual style to this. It's harder and harder to enjoy JW movies just cause how blown up they've become.What if feels like is a movie written by a 15 y.o. action movie fan, or a 35 y.o. dude who was a 15 y.o. action movie fan in the 90s, but never grew up.",

        "text": "I enjoyed the first two John Wick movies, the first a bit more than the second. They weren't on the same level as say the Bourne movies but they were ok. So I was looking forward to this one. Unfortunately it failed to maintain even the so-so quality of the first two.First of all, one absurd plot twist is followed by another and then another. Actions are explained by; \"well he had a marker, I had no choice\". \"Markers don't matter to The Table!, I'm afraid you'll have to die\"....then why the f%$ck does anyone have markers and use them or honor them then if in the end they have no significance??Then; John Wick cashed in his \"ticket\". But all it get's him is one small favor and then he \"can't go home again.\" So what good is the frigging ticket in the first place??Then; John Wick uses one of his \"markers\" which again, will probably get the character he has it on killed and that begs the question once again, why would anyone use an effing marker!!! And he uses it to learn how to solve his problem which it turns out is by walking into the desert to ask for redemption which he's given if he chooses to agree to a certain deal, and oh yeah, cut off his finger and give up his wedding ring. The he goes back to NYC and immediately decides that he's not going to honor the deal after all, thus negating his redemption! Then why use a marker, thus putting another person life in danger, have to kill a whole bunch of people...again, risk death by walking out into the desert, agree to a deal and to cutting off your finger, if the next frigging day you're going to decide to just toss the entire deal anyway and end up still being hunted??? What exactly was the point to even seeking the deal in the first place...or in that entire plot line??Then; the manager of the Continental Hotel is in trouble because he helped John Wick. So he swears to fight along side Wick and his hotel desk clerk against the people that want them both dead. After dozens are killed and his hotel trashed in yet another cartoonish action sequence he says wait, never mind, and reneges on his promise to Wick....something he could have done a frigging hour earlier and avoided losing half his staff, not to mention all the dead bodies cluttering up his hotel!The point here is that the plot had no point. Characters followed one set of rules until it didn't work for the plot and those rules were tossed for a brand new set, and then that didn't work so they completely change direction again. There was no logic or coherent thought to the story, none of the characters actions made any sense. The plot was just a poorly written vehicle to allow everyone to fight with each other for two hours.And that brings up another point; there were so many fight scenes that after a while they all just looked the same. It actually got boring. And let's just overlook the fact that John Wick should have been dead a dozen times over from being hit by cars...or falling off of buildings...or being shot...or stabbed, or beaten to a pulp. It's like playing a video game with endless lives, no matter what happens the main character never dies. After a while you can't help but realize that it's not that John Wick is that much of a badass because he's constantly getting his ass kicked, it's that he's the main character so he just can't die....not matter what. And that's boring too because no matter what happens he's going to get through it. Kind of kills any suspense for the viewer. Part four is due out next spring and I think I'll pass because I'm sure I've already seen it all already in the first three movies.",

        "text": "\"John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum\" is an interesting flick. Filled with gorgeously choreographed and badass action, John Wick 3 has one of the strongest opening sequences I've seen in any action movie. The opening 25 minutes features some of the most visually stunning, hardcore action scenes I've ever seen. Someone gets a book shoved into their mouth and their jaw broken with it, a man gets stabbed in the eye and the camera does not shy away, and of course, there's a shooting or two packed in there. The tension is high, the suspense is palpable, and the action is incredible. With no shaky camera and no quick cuts, everything is shown clearly in all it's visceral brutality; one part in particular was so brutal that everyone in my theatre collectively groaned. But unfortunately, when you open a movie that ridiculously strong, everything that follows seems to pale in comparison.There's no way around this so I'll just say it: after while, John Wick 3 gets boring. There are only so many times you can see someone get shot in the head before it starts to get stale, and John Wick 3 gets stale quick with overly drawn out action sequences and a middling second act that by the end feels pointless for ever happening in the first place. Don't get me wrong, the action is better than any action film released this year; you haven't seen action this slick and clean since \"John Wick 2.\" But because of how fantastic the first 25 minutes were, the rest of the action just doesn't seem as fun to watch.And like I mentioned, the middle of this movie is simply boring. I won't spoil much, but it involves John Wick traveling through the desert. It's not only boring to watch, but the overall effect it has on the story is pretty much pointless by the end, and on top of that, John's goal doesn't seem to make any sense or even matter by the time the movie ends.That being said, Keanu Reeves (or as he's called in the pick up community, Kino Reeves) is good, as always. Him as John Wick is riveting to watch. He's always a badass and a force to be reckoned with, and that's no exception here, even though he is tired and worn down from the events of the previous films. But this adds a new layer to the action. He's no longer as strong and no longer as efficient. In this film he gets beaten, and beaten badly, and I enjoyed watching this seemingly invincible character being pushed to his limit. Where in the previous movies he's so efficient that he knew he'd be able to kill all his enemies with little to no effort, in this movie he's so tired and broken down that it's obvious he's putting his all into trying not to die. And that was exciting viewing. The world building, too, continues to be enthralling. This world of underground assassins that's been built up since the first movie is so interesting to watch, and I wouldn't be surprised if something like that actually exists in real life. You also get to see a lot more of the Continental hotel, which was a very welcome addition.\"John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum\" is by no stretch of the imagination a bad movie. The action, world building, fight choreography, cinematography, directing, and acting are all very well done. You won't see a better action movie this year, that's for sure. But, and I can't believe I'm saying this, there was just a little too much action, and a too little story. And this formula worked for the first two films, but they really need to switch up their act if they want to keep these movies fresh.6/10",

But, shouldn't there be something else? like, for example, a story? I will summarize the film: John is hunted by his employees and he runs from them, killing everything on his way. That's it. That's the whole movie.\nFX are good, action scenes are good, performances are average and, unlike previous John Wick movies, in this chapter, you have no feeling for the character. they lost all depth or sense of reality. They are all killing machines without sense, brain or feelings. I couldn't wait for the movie to be over.\nChoreography is good but so repetitive. Every fight John Wick plays the same moves over and over. It looks like judo students practicing.\nIt seems the creators of the movie just ran out of ideas to kill people. The only scene that seemed a bit different was the Casablanca scene, where they had the great idea of adding killer dogs. Why not? in the next one maybe there will be killer cats or murdering flying sharks. Nothing makes sense any way. That scene though, was SO FAKE. My wife explained it perfectly: it seemed like a show from Universal Studios. With stunts dropping onto mattresses or boxes.\nIn general the movie is boring with no story to keep you interested.\nAvoid at all cost.",

        "text": "John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is so far the best John Wick installment since the first one back in 2014. Movie franchises have been known to have terrible 3rd installments, but it seems that John Wick is an exception. The John Wick movies have been consistently getting better, and this series still has a lot of potential.The biggest problem that I had with John Wick: Chapter 2 was how it lacked in innovation. It was exactly like the first, and it barely built upon this universe. John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum doesn't suffer this problem. John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum adds so much more to this world in the best ways possible. This movie feels so much more fresh than the second movie, and I couldn't image how awful it would've been if it was exactly like the last two.I like how in all the sequels, they always start from when the last one ended. So it's always best to watch the previous movie in order to get a good understanding of what's happening in the current one. What's so great about this franchise is that it started small, then built an A-list cast. Keanu Reeves, Ian McShane, Halle Berry, and Laurence Fishburne. With every new movie, they add more talent. And on a side note, they set up the sequel so perfectly in John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum.What isn't a surprise is that John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum has great action and fighting scenes. The camerawork and directing is obviously very well professionally done. And Keanu himself proves once again that he was perfect for this role.John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is yet another great installment in this amazing series. With every new movie, I always find myself being entertained like no other action movie. John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is a sure recommend for me.",

The fights just look like choreography, John should be dead so many times it makes Rambo look realistic. They have just set out to make the violence and body count as high as possible. It's like watching a cartoon. Why doesn't anyone just shoot him in the head? Why is he in the desert? How does he get horses to kick people in the head on demand? If you like laughing at people getting killed in silly over the top ways then watch it, if not, there's really nothing here for you.",

Having killed a man on consecrated ground, John is ex-communicated with a $14 bounty as everyone who is \"under the Table\" is out to kill him. John still has friends and markers for what they are worth...and a dog.The is also an adjudicator (Asia Kate Dillon), a cold-hearted woman who metes out punishment for those who aided John Wick after he violated the rule.There is lots of killing and deadly Halle Berry. I will give away the ending...it leads into another film. What would have made the film more interesting is if they showed the bounty going up as the list of the dead increases.There is a director walk-on and numerous nods to other films including \"The Matrix.\"Guide: F-word.

But often the the violence is so Tom and Jerry that it's hilarious. One scene in particular involving glass cases is hysterically funny. The acting is non existent - not that any is required of the \"script\" I have to say. Every other person on the planet appears to be some kind of super assassin ( not as super as Keanu obviously) and their leader lives in the desert a million miles from anywhere, although someone does actually give Keanu directions!!!

Hale Berry? Really? Of all the amazing female actresses out there, they chose her? She clearly didn't have the mood or interest to act for this movies. Also, John apparently suffers from amnesia since he now, for some reason, wants back into the assassins' world? And the one supreme dude lives in the Morocco dessert? How?

The final big shootout is pretty cool and funny, and the Halle Berry action scene is also pretty badass, with a lot of long single takes.The big final fight with these 3 badass ninja assassins was cool, but it went on a little bit too long. I mean, how many times do we have to see them kick John Wick through glass? It went on a little bit too long, but it is still pretty cool.There are some pretty funny comedic scenes in this movie, and John Wick doesn't really say much besides \"yes,\" and \"go.\"Anyways, if you want to see a horse kick a man's head backwards then go watch John Wick 3!",

But what about the characters? There are no characters. Wick himself has become a caricature of a caricature, the chief villain (based in a C19TH desert nomadic camp!) Is laughable, the chief instrument of the villain is simply wooden, the indestructible ninja killers is trope we have seen too many times and is frankly racist, McShane & Fishburne are clearly just along for the pay cheque adding nothing of value and the host of incompetent assassins is cringeworthy. Which brings us to the core problem, for an international assassination bureau this organisation is both completely dysfunction and utterly incompetent, even by the standards of the franchise it just doesn't work but the star and the producers are perfectly happy insulting audiences with this drivel.\nOne final point, with so many bodies piling up, and boy do they pile up, you never hear a police siren, never see a policeman; in one utterly stupid scene Wick savagely slices up one of the unbeatable ninjas in Grand Central and nothing happens, literally nothing! Crowds of commuters just walk pass! It was almost like they took stock footage and just superimposed it. Insulting film making.\nDon't watch.",

Everything from the direction, camerawork, fight choreography, set design, music and lighting is superbly polished, making it gorgeous to watch. John Wick: Chapter 3 carries this on very effectively.It's just glorious action cinema from start to finish. Keanu Reeves is just a living legend at this point with how he commits fully to the role. Stahelski also rightly gets much praise for how he handles the fight sequences with such grace.Somehow the action has managed to keep on improving from the first instalment, and the brutality is also upped as well, which I didn't think would be possible after what was delivered in Chapter 2.The additions to the cast are also pretty good. Halle Berry is solid, although her character is not involved nearly as much as I thought she was going to be. Mark Dacascos was also great as Zero, who was a worthy foe for John to take on in hand-to-hand combat. The introduction of Asia Kate Dillon as the Adjudicator was also intriguing, as it gave us our first glimpse of the mysterious High Table, which undoubtedly will be explored in further films.Also the world-building is once again on-point, slowly revealing morsels of information about the society of assassins. However, this is also the film's greatest weakness as it expands the world so much that what story there is becomes unfocused.I adore these films, and whilst this is certainly the weakest of the three, it's still a highly-engaging piece. I can't wait to see what they do next, as the prospect of John teaming up with the Bowery King to take on the High Table sounds great in concept.",

So the Russians are actually Belarusian Gypsies? But nothing aside from the main boss women's clothing indicates they are Gypsies. What gypsies are obsessed with ballet and stuff. It just felt very wrong. It would have made more sense if they had some sort of trailer park / tent and or their base was a circus. Bit more stereotypical, but just strange to me that they made him Roma. Roma are mostly involved in minor crime like pickpocketing and prostitution they aren't an ultra organized gang that control Russian mob and create super assassins.They try to be so PC but the manager of the Moroccan intercontinental is an African American female? And the other big guy in Morroco (boss of the mint) is this European white dude? I mean... why not use Moroccans or at least Arabs/Berbers.And leaders of the table are some Arab bedouins? What? ... I mean seriously, what?! Why? Why didn't John just kill them right then and there? From what I saw they had zero protection kt was just a tent caravan with a bunch if colorfully dressed Bedouins.There is this scene where they are fighting and John puts a book infront of the villains head and hits the..book? That was dumb. Cool that he used the book to break his jaw and neck moments later but that first part was bad choreography.\nAlso there was this part where they were fighting amid stone vats filled with \"molten gold\". It was in the Moroccan mint where they made the golden assassin coins. The molten gold literally looked like liquid gold. That's not how molten metal looks. It should have been bright white/orange.\nMerhaba means \"welcome\" not \"welcome back\"And I don't understand why he didn't cut his finger like the yakuza, like the top.of it. He removed almost all of the finger weakening his hand tremendously",

Use grenades, flash bangs, nets, eletricity, gas, etc. 5) Don't kill your allies. 6) Don't give Wick a chance to recover if you intend to kill him. 7) Don't give him an armored suit without a GPS on it. 8) Don't give time for your enemy to hole up in to a good defense position. 9) Stop giving weapons and ammo by getting close to Wick. 10) If you have armor that is immune to bullets, go forward and kill him, instead of waiting for him to get better weapons. 11) Don't let unarmed people, who are going to order other people to murder you, alive.",

        "text": "John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is an action film that delights, practically revels, in violence - so much so that one can reasonably draw comparisons to the visceral sequences in other contemporary foreign action films like The Raid series (which is fitting considering Yayan Ruhian and Cecep Arif Rahman, who both star in The Raid and The Raid 2, appear in this film). It's also not too shy of developing its narrative either, or more accurately, its world-building. What was once a humble little world in the first film in the series is now an ever-expanding labyrinth of alliances and hidden societies that make you question how deep these organizations (and Wick's relationships) run. Chapter 3's cast is largely the same, with a few highlights like Sofia (Halle Berry) and her vicious pack of dogs or the Adjudicator as a compelling antagonist, being suitably arrogant and condescending. The plot is also straightforward enough as to be expected, with its ending being particularly noteworthy. Winston's apparent betrayal of John Wick feels earned, seems in-character and I didn't see it coming at all, which is more than can be expected of many action movie plot twists. But make no mistake: despite my praise for the film's world design, much of the film's emphasis is still placed on the action sequences as it should be.There's so much action in fact to the point where, near the end, my eyes were starting to get numb to what was happening onscreen. Wait, am I really going to criticise an action movie for having too much action? Well, kinda...sorta...not really. Look, the action and cinematography for all of the sequences was entertaining and it always, at the very least, kept things fresh through the choreography, camera work, environment and lighting. And the film knew what it was and didn't try to be anything more than an intense, stylised, action extravaganza. As a complete package though? It doesn't excel at everything, but it didn't necessarily need to. In all, I'd say John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is highly entertaining if somewhat exhausting, but it's still well worth a watch. But if you're a John Wick fan, you didn't need me to tell you that.Overall: mid-to-high 7/10, maybe low 8/10.",

Kick-ass continuation in the action franchise with laconic assassin-on-the run/dog lover Wick (Reeves having a helluva field day) facing immense odds on his life with practically EVERYONE out to kill him with a $14M bounty on his head. Proving that excessive violence never solved anything, the outrageous graphic violence is plentiful (um alert Guinness for record held in head shots alone!) and gleefully over the top absurd (a lethal fight has its victim reflect on just what a battle he's been in) and gainfully entertaining. Buckle up. (Dir : Chad Stahelski)",

        "text": "I liked the first John Wick and the second. All in all it's a cool idea and the action is very clear and good choreographed. The look of this movie is professional, sure. And I got the nice reference on 'The Good, The Bad & The Ugly', when John Wick re-asembled some old weapons in a weapon museum like Tuco Ramirez did in the old western with Clint Eastwood. After some playtime I had the first feeling of being bored. It seemed that the creativity of the action exhausted.I can imagine that the creators had the same idea and made a big deal: They let one big evil guy shoot at a dog (which has a bullet proof vest). So the dog can take its revenge and bite the bad guys nuts. A shocking moment, ok. But after that the fugitive John Wick and his female partner fight through the army of guards using the dogs as weapons by letting them bite the nuts of the guys. These are cheap shock moments for saving some money instead of creating better action. After a bunch of further nut bites, we stopped the movie. It became more and more ridiculous.This is just shockbaiting people with cheap methods. The nuts are allways the best shockers. Only kicking or stabbing wasn't enough, ok. But why not choosing really new ideas? This series lost its charme. After 1 hour and 8 minutes we were just bored by always seing the same dumb shock moment and turned that crap of.If the story would have been better, we would have turned a blind eye. But the only fresh moment was when Anjelica Huston arrived on screen. The hunting scenario is not better than any teenager countdown in cheap horror movies. Just vice versa. So the bullet clips have 100 bullets each? There are hundrets or thousands of assassins in a city and surely an army of underground organization crime-scene-cleaners for sure, so there are no press people or cops involved. (Really?) Normaly we would have turned a blind eye. But that movie was clearly too much crap.",

Surely if you've seen John Wick 1 and 2 you know what you're going to get - so what more do you want?\nIt's a case of switch off brain, find edge of seat and have a comfy cushion for when your jaw drops again and again. It's beautifully brutal entertainment and I'm ok with that, I don't always need a gripping plot.\nThe fight scenes are not repetitive in my opinion, they are relentless and seem to go on and on - which is exhausting to watch, but feels realistic. Highly skilled combatants can fight beyond pain and injury that would render us mere mortals flat out finished - plus it's bloody fantastical entertainment is it not? It's not meant to be literal New York City.\nI love how gangly and uncoordinated Keane Reeves can appear - then the fight starts and he's brutally efficient and makes hilarious use of whatever is to hand. I mean, I'll never look at my books in the same way, and the horses were used to exceptional effect.\nI thought Halle Berry was great, and her beautiful Mallinois dogs - weapons of mass  destruction!\nIt was also rather amusing to see old Mark Dacascus brought out of the martial arts closet - I liked his character.\nWick quoting from the Matrix with his \"I need guns, lots of guns\" did make me smile.\nA visual triumph, a masterpiece of hand to hand combat choreography, beautiful canine killing machines - for me the perfect Sunday afternoon switch-off from life movie.

        "text": "Least we appear animals, much ado is made about rules in the slam-bang threequel \"John Wick Chapter 3 - Parabellum,\" with Keanu Reeves reprising his role as the fearless gunman whose rampage arose after a gangster shot his puppy to death. This bullet-riddled, melodramatic trilogy about a vengeful retired hitman wronged by his former accomplices seems like the last place where anybody would abide by rules. The international underworld depicted in this second globe-trotting entry maintains an inflexible code of rules. For example, a prestigious Continental Hotel operates in virtually every country and serves as much as a safehouse for criminals as a mode of accommodation. Comparably, these Continentals resemble foreign embassies because each provides safe refuge for criminals. Specifically, Continental Hotels forbid gunplay on the premises between members of any crime families. Violating the sanctity of a Continental Hotel means immediate excommunication. Excommunication means you die. If you missed the first two \"John Wick\" shoot'em ups, you would be surprised by the magnitude of this criminal code. Director Chad Stahelski, who helmed the original \"John Wick\" as well as the sequel \"John Wick: Chapter 2,\" spends more time on this code and its consequences. Marginally longer than the previous entries, the third outing makes room for an adjudicator. This imperious personage scrutinizes the facts, judges everybody implicated, and arbitrates an outcome. Nevertheless, despite these loquacious interludes, \"John Wick 3\" still delivers high-octane, adrenalin-laced action scenes with pugnacious adversaries. Halle Berry joins Keanu Reeves as a gun-toting dame with two vicious, crotch-munching canines. Fans of the earlier epics should be gratified considering the astronomical high body count, the acrobatic close-quarters combat choreography, and our charismatic hero's resilience. Of course, little of this aggressive, over-the-top actioneer qualifies as remotely plausible, but it makes for cathartic, larger-than-life entertainment!\"John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum\" opens during the final moments of \"John Wick: Chapter 2.\" Our drenched but well-dressed hero and his faithful dog jog through the rainswept streets of Manhattan. Even the homeless know about John Wick's predicament. Pausing for a breather in an alley, Wick spots a homeless man (Jason Mantzoukas of \"Neighbors\") who taps his wristwatch and says: \"Tick Tock!\" Suspense rears its ugly head early as we are reminded repeatedly about the few remaining minutes until 6 PM when Wick's excommunication commences. Meantime, every greedy soul is drooling over the prospect of the $14 million 'open contract' payday on Wick's scalp. Our hero looks worried, too. Wick packs his dog off to the Continental via taxi, while he hoofs it to the New York Public Library. No, Keanu isn't on screen for every minute of this threequel's 130-minute running time. Those bespectacled, tattooed secretaries at the High Table Headquarters who type documents and slap ink stamps on them provide updates. The Underworld constitutes big business, with its own peculiar laws and its own watch-dog agencies. The high-brow Adjudicator (newcomer Asia Kate Dillon) marches into the fray. She takes names and levies penalties. John Wick isn't the only one with something to dread in this installment. The Adjudicator reprimands both Winston (Ian McShane of \"Deadwood\") and Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne of \"The Matrix\") for giving aid and comfort to John Wick. Remember, King gave John seven bullets and a pistol, while Winston gave him an hour to flee before loosening an army of executioners. The Adjudicator conscripts a nimble-fingered, sushi-chef/contract killer, Zero (world renowned Martial Artist Mark Dacascos of \"Cradle 2 the Grave\") to dispense punishment. Everything starts out without a hint about the rollercoaster ride ahead for audiences and some of the surprising narrative twists.Not everybody is content to accommodate the deadline. No sooner has our hero arrived at the New York Public Library than a familiar adversary confronts him. This is the first glimpse of what lies ahead. A contract killer has staked out the stacks, and he dwarfs John Wick in both size and stature. Our hero disposes of this dastard with a thick book. Although he is still fond of the double-tap head shot, Wick doesn't always have pistol at hand to vanquish his enemies. His clash with a gang of chop-socky Asians turns into a blizzard of flying knives. Later, Wick proves he is every bit as dangerous with a hatchet. At one point, he hurls a hatchet halfway across a room, and the somersaulting blade sinks into an enemy's skull. Wick can sling knives with the best of them, too. Our hero shuns automobiles in favor of a horse. Some lighter moments occurs when Wick slaps a horse on the rump, and the animal whips a hind leg back like a catapult to deck an unsuspecting gunman. Wicks contends with several Asians on motorcycles bristling with traditional samurai Shinogi-Zukuri katanas. All these close-quarters combat scenes are staged with as little CGI as possible. The physical violence seems almost kinetic at times. Wick slams into his enemies, toppling them, and wrestling their weapons away from them. As impeccable as always, Wick emerges from each fracas without any damage to his suit.Director Chad Stahelski and scenarists Derek Kolstad, Shay Hatten, Chris Collins, and Marc Abrams plunge even deeper into John Wick's shadowy origins. Wick appeals for help from an old friend, a ballet director (Anjelica Huston of \"The Addams Family\"), who knew him before he emigrated to America. Wicks' roots can be traced back to Eastern Europe. Happily, our hero crosses the Atlantic Ocean without incident and reaches the shores of Casablanca. Wick calls on Sofia (Halle Berry of \"Die Another Day\"), to honor a marker owed him, but she isn't happy to see him again. Nevertheless, she ushers him into the presence of a prominent member of the High Table to atone for his sins. Although she isn't in \"John Wick 3\" more than a quarter hour, Sofia and her two canine ice almost as many adversaries as our hero, and she makes an unforgettable impression. \"John Wick 3\" orchestrates even more outlandish escapades than its exhilarating predecessors.",

        "text": "Spoiler warning just to be safe.John Wick: Parabellum is better than John Wick 2, but does not have the same strength in story as the first John Wick film. Where it exceeds is the action choreography and the consequences of actions coming back to bite the characters. It also gave a hint of John Wick's backstory, which was nice. Another strong point is that the main antagonist (Zero) was enjoyable. He was skilled, brought dark humor and had a determination to prove himself. Unlike Caspian, Zero actually lived up to the hype. It honestly was kind of sad to see him go, but he definitely gave John a good beating. Sofia was also another good character that left a good impression with her gun okay, her dogs and a bit of inner conflict. I would even suggest that her dogs help her cope with the choices she had to make prior to Parabellum. It will be great if she returns should there be a Chapter 4.Now one of the weak points of the film is that they expanded the role of the High Table, which at first glance is not bad, but what they did was made their influence so massive that it brings one to wonder who *isn't* under their control? The opportunity to introduce more factions was missed. Also, while the action choreography was great, the story felt overall shallow and was bizarre in some parts. Particularly with the introduction of the Elder and the last scene between John and Winston. They also missed out on an opportunity to show off Charon and took the lazy route by having the Continental security get wiped out in the final act way too fast instead of having an epic gun battle between High Table and supposedly one of the most secured buildings in New York. Essentially, the world building that was used was used poorly, and opportunities were missed to expand in more than one area of John Wick's world.John Wick: Parabellum is not a terrible movie, but it is not as good as it could have been. If you want a movie with great action, this is the one for you. But John Wick 1 so far has the best story out of the three.",

Sorry, and the fights didn't really add up enough to make it special.\nA little bit more story and acting and less fighting would have done a lot.\nThere were some interesting scenes with the dogs, nicely trained guys, but action in the stables with horses around seemed like calling for animal protection activist.\nI can't look behind the scenes to know how they got the horses to react like that, but I didn't like it.\nAll in all, it was ok to watch, but it wasn't anywhere close to the first two parts.\nDo a little more next time. You might have a 7.8 average here at the moment, but I don't know where that comes from. Are we that far that all what is needed for a good rating, is a lot of bang bang? I like action and fighting in movies, but even Kwai Chang Kane's fighting was more interesting. Learn from that.",

If you see the first one, the reason of all the berserk rage was just a \". This series is just based in the premise: You have an assasin, the best in the world, a real Baba Yaga... he was retired but he´s now on business and will destroy everyone and everything\".\nUnder that paradigm, this movie is perfect. A lot of action and kills. Here you will see \"too much killing\". But under the John´s Universe is understandable.About the movie. Is well written, great actions scenes and some of the best killing i´ve ever seen. He kill someone with a horse and with a book, that must be a record guiness or something like that.In the end, the John Wick´s Saga is set in 2 chapters. The first one is the return of John as an assasin under the \"Table\" orders (John Wick 1 and 2) and the second one of John´s Rebellion (John Wick 3 and 4). So is understandable that this movie has some lack of narrative. Is a building up movie. In the next we will see something similar to the first one.This movie is awesome and has the same 80s action movie vibe. Is highly recommended and you will have a great time.",

The second installment barely clung onto the original story lines and started to go off on an action only tangent. The third one, I love my action movies but when I see 300 rounds being emptied into an enclosed space and JW doesn't get hit or even grazed.This could have been so much better with a third of the action and let the characters develop. Instead we got a world of inept assassins. Believe me, if I saw JW (who never took the time to disguise himself what so ever), I would have shot him from fifty feet away rather than engage in close combat. Sure, the story line would have ended very quickly but it would have been believable.\nThe writers need to take a leaf out of the Jack Reacher series. The character is not superhuman, they don't have unlimited round hand guns and if you fall from a 7 story building after being hit with four rounds and bounce off rooftops and stair wells on the way down, you simply cannot survive.\nI had high hopes for this franchise but it looks like the audience being played to is pre-pubescent teens who thrive on first person shoot em ups in immortality mode.",

The sequel was heavy on the close quarters combat, the tactical gun play between pistol, shotgun and rifle and mostly delivered though some of the character development or just quality of actors was not on par with the first.The third instalment starts out well hitting hard with great successive action scenes including the knife fight and the great horse shoot out. Somewhere after this things started to lag. I think it was the moment the adjudicator character turns up to be fun police. That's how it felt. Along come the rules to curb the crazy balls out fun we loved in the first instalment.The rest of the movie is a bit scrappy and although we have high velocity action pawn all over the place it doesn't quite hit the spot.I was left puzzled at the end and gave up on ever caring about the next instalment.",

John Wick 2 carried on with the interesting world building, unsurpassed fight choreography and superbly shot scenes. So could they up the ante with yet another John Wick entry?The answer is yeah.... pretty much.While some of the shine has come off the scintillating gun play and the story is very lean, it still works because of the practical effects, long, uninterrupted camera shots and dedication of the actors and stunt crew to provide incredible fight scenes you won't find elsewhere. This is not your superhero movie, headache-inducing CGI action... this is as real as it gets.The addition of Halle Berry's character and her dogs (a jaw-dropping sequence unlike anything I've ever seen) was welcome and injected some new life into the story and lore. She obviously took her weapons training as seriously as Keanu Reeves did because she looked just as competent and capable dispatching endless henchmen in elegant style; and still one of the most gorgeous women anywhere.Our hero fights his way through countless assassins out to claim the bounty on his head and Mark Dacascos (how is this guy not a bigger star?) is a bright spot as Zero, the master of a sushi chef clan of ninjas working for the \"High Table\". Keanu looks tired by the end and I hoped he would finally get his rest but it seems there is one more chapter to be added to this story.I'm still interested enough to look forward to it.",

Now of course the exceptions should be respected. 1. People like to get their inner shoot- em up out and John Wick helps that along. 2. If you are into video games which are so real to life and play out just like this movie, you will get your high here. Wick #1 had me. Wick #2 had me. In Wick #3, I started to feel had.

        "text": "John Wick 3 delivers on the action part greatly throughout the whole movie. It is so well shot and and made that it feels real and Keanu Reeves is just plain awesome. He gives it his all in terms of a physical and character performance. He does great in the action as well as adding depth to the character of John Wick. Though in the movie we don't really know his motivation to do all this until almost the end of the movie. And it's a decent motivation, but not a great one. Halle berry's character Sofia was also really good and the dogs that she has are just so loyal and badass. That one fight scene with all the dogs had me cheering on the inside. The evil lady who is trying to take down John was just awful, but Zero is really funny and a really physical threat along with his gang of ninjas. Also can I just flat out state that I love Charon and the Bowery King. They are really charismatic in this movie and I love it so much. I also enjoyed Jerome Flynn's cameo because I've seen him in Game of Thrones and love him too. One other thing like I said earlier not only is the action so well shot it's so brutal and acted it doesn't even really need music in the background to make it entertaining. Although the action can sometimes drag on a bit long but overall it was really great. Also the ending sets up John Wick 4, with John and the Bowery King going up against the high table. I need that now!\nOverall this movie has really great Action, acting, stunt people, intensity, and just a bunch of actors I personally love who give it their all in the roles they playFinal rating: 9.2/10",

Such great choreographed fight scenes, great acting and an intriguing story leaving a nice cliffhanger for at least one more movie. Really expanded their universe with this one. Really fleshed it out and god...John Wick is just a BEAST and really lived up to his legened as the Boogeyman. I lost count of the people he fought and beat sometimes 3/4 against just himself. Oh and that fight with Hallie Berrie and the dogs was just...incredible. i had a silly grin on my face most of the time watchingthis film (when my jaw wasn't on the floor) and only sat on the edge of my seat. Each new film gives us something new and this one did not dissapoint. A must see!!",

        "text": "Where do I start? How about that star rating? Not enough stars. I need to add my own rating to the star rating and it is this: When watching an action movie, how many of your hands are up, how many of your feet are up, are you in the fetal position because your feet and hands are up, and are you watching the screen, and for how long are you in this position?So I have to add two hands, two feet, fetal position, watching the screen, for the majority of the movie so I'll make that an extra seven points (for length of time spent in this position in a movie theatre seat ever in my life) and here's why: I like action movies, depending upon the characters and the story line; I love martial arts movies; I love beautiful cinematography; and as a writer, I go for anything with a story line that really captivates me. JW3 has it all. I had no rest.If you haven't seen JW1 and JW2, if you want a story line that invests you in the movie, see the first two (or rewatch them) and then definitely see this on the big screen while you can. In JW1 we learn about John Wick's grief over losing his wife Helen to illness (for whom he had been able to leave his assassin's life) and the murder of the puppy she left him so that he would be consoled after her death. In JW2, he re-enters his role as an assassin against his will. At the end, he breaks a major rule in a society that does, indeed, have rules of conduct, engagement, decorum, and retribution for transgressions. Don't conduct business (assassination) in the Continental.Within the first ten minutes I had one foot facing the screen. JW3, like JW2, goes full throttle out of the gate. Oh - be sure you use the restroom before the movie starts, because you will have absolutely no breaks.It all begins in the library, after John Wick asks the cabbie to take his dog back to the Continental. Kudos to Chad Stahelski for making the librarian an important part of this sequence, because she does know where the book is. Important keys to the development of John Wick's history are there. Along with an assassin who isn't willing to wait. A really tall assassin. The martial arts sequence in the stacks of the New York Public Library is mind-blowing. The weapon of opportunity: a book. Humor blow Number One.But wait-there's more! As John Wick runs down the streets through Chinatown, he's followed. Wonderful to see the first of three homages to The Matrix in this sequence - Keanu Reeves (John Wick) and Tiger Chen (the fishmonger) in a non-stop brutal martial arts fight. One foot up.And then, the horses. No, not just one (maybe you've seen that on social media already, the horse/motorcycle chase?) Before that, there's the fight sequence in the stables with, I couldn't even keep track, four horses? Five horses? One of the horses definitely gets into the fighting thanks to a slap on the hindquarters from John Wick. I definitely had two feet up by then.As a writer, I appreciated the increased world-building as the back story of who John Wick is, and how he came to be, unfolds. Despite this interlude from the action, my two feet did not come back to rest on the theatre floor.No, it's not just about a puppy. Passage granted, brand endured, John Wick heads for Morocco, where there is an old friend. There are more dogs. Sofia's (Halle Berry's) dogs. Sofia runs the Casablanca Continental, and she owes John Wick a debt. During an attempt to help him, her dogs show just what they can do. A gun fight to get out starts when another assassin shoots one of Sofia's dogs (who happens to be wearing Kevlar, of course). The dogs have their own biting way of entering combat, and it's not pretty. Her rationale after it's all over? \"He shot my dog.\" John Wick: \"Yeah, I get it.\"From the trek across the Saharan sands to find someone who can help John Wick get back to New York in his battle against the organization called the High Table so that he may be free of his assassin's life to just mourn his wife's unexpected passing (a request that comes at a high price) to his encounter with the ninjas led by an assassin named Zero (Mark Descascos - another excellent martial artist who delivers humor at the unlikeliest of times), the action continues in amazing sets, stunningly photographed, revealing that all of the principal actors in this movie aren't just acting - they're also athletes. More on that later.Wick fights ninjas during a motorcycle chase at the start of the movie, only to encounter them again in glass rooms where everything can be seen and yet they disappear, the fight sequences are over the top not only in comparison to JW2 but for anything I've seen - because this is hand-to-hand combat with actors who have trained in martial arts. That in and of itself makes this movie a must-see for anyone who loves martial arts, cinematography, choreography, weapons training...I could go on.As a writer, I still want a story. Martial arts without a story doesn't really engage me. With a story? It absolutely does. Stahelski and Reeves as self-named graduates of the Wachowski school of world-building (which they learned while working on The Matrix) do this proud. So proud that the first scene with the Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne) shows him drenched in rain (evocative of his scene in The Matrix where he's rescued - here, he's not). When at the last fight scene John Wick answer's Winston's (Ian McShane) question, \"what do you need?\" He replies, \"Guns. Lots of Guns.\"The Adjudicator (Asia Kate Dillon) who has delivered retribution to the Bowery King and the Director (Anjelica Huston) for their assistance to John Wick waits in the Continental for the gunfire of the last battle to be over quicly. It's not. Let's just say...the last bullets fired set up the scenario for John Wick Chapter 4, because I'm not sure he was wearing a tactical suit (he got a new suit in Morocco - was it? Wasn't it?). And who shoots whom? I'm not saying. The thicken plots (to turn a hackneyed phrase into a spoonerism).My hands and feet? I can't even remember at which action sequence they ended up all up toward the screen. All I know is that I spent about two hours in my theatre seat in the fetal position, and sometimes, yes I did yell though I didn't cover my eyes.I'm still blown away. You will be too. As I got up to leave, the man in the seat a couple of rows behind me was speaking to the woman he was sitting beside, saying \"I got the time of the movie wrong, now we've seen the end, so why stay?\" I looked at him and said, \"You have to stay - in the first ten minutes you will totally forget what you just saw.\" Here's why, and it goes to a comment Chad Stahelski made in response to a question about a potential Academy Award for Best Stuntman/woman. His reply, in short, and JW3 demonstrates this, is that excellent action films are a collaborative effort. JW3 relies on stuntmen (which Reeves is ready to admit he is not - he has a stunt double, Reeves just does action); it relies on actors (Reeves, Berry, Reddick, and others) to learn how to fight in whatever milieu is needed for the plot - martial arts, gunplay, a combination thereof; and in order to show what these people actually do, the cinematography itself.This movie is an example of how moviemaking is a team effort, that actors learn not just lines but a whole lot more if they want to do an action picture, and that the eye of the photographer (Dan Rautsen) is as important as the director's ability to frame the scene based upon the vision. When the Academy decides to create an award for such a movie, John Wick Chapter 3: Parabellum needs to be the benchmark.Isabeau Vollhardt\nauthor, The Casebook of Elisha Grey scifi/detective e-book series",

I don't know, the lore needs explaining more, there's a scene in Grand Central Station where some bad guys are killed right in front of civilians and no one bats and eyelid, is this something in the lore i missed?Absolutely no idea what Jerome Flynn's accent was meant to be! vaguely Eastern European??Sequel bait at the end was cringeworthy.The dogs were cool though!",

        "text": "John Wick 3 - Parabellum is the best of the 3.This film starts up where #2 ended John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is running through the streets of New York having been given 1 hour to get out for breaking the rules. (Killing a man on Continental grounds.)As time breaks down to 6pm, Wick frantically looks for ways to escape and as word gets out he is now excommunicado this becomes increasingly more difficult. He finds himself it the library where he has hidden a stash of gold etc. within a book of Russian literature. This book becomes the weapon of choice to dispatch the first assailant.6 pm... now every one is after him as a $14 million bounty has been put on his head. What follows is a high body count as Wick is chased through the streets of New York and he dispenses every person attacking him in very imaginative ways. Horses, knives, guns and shear brutality are used.As this is happening an adjudicator from the High Table (Asia Kate Dillon) turns up at the Continental and gives Winston (Ian McShane) 7 days to get his affairs in order before he is then replaced. His punishment for defying the High Table and letting Wick live. Naturally Winston is not happy having given 40 years service.Meanwhile Wick has turned up at a theatre owned by a Belorussian (Angelica Houston) and demands that she help him escape New York to Casablanca. \"I have a ticket I want to cash it in\" reluctantly she agrees a safe passage knowing this will defy the Table and bring certain death to the theatre.Meanwhile the adjudicator has recruited a Japanese gang to help dish out the punishment and visits The Bowery King (Lawrence Fishburne) and again gives him 7 days to get his affairs in order and relinquish his throne. His punishment for helping Wick with 7 bullets. This amuses The Bowery King who refuses to budge.Wick has now reached Casablanca and as he walks through the streets word has got out that he is there and he is soon cornered within the alleys. More bodies mount up lucky for some Sofia (Halle Berry) has granted him amnesty and he is taken to The Continental, which she is in charge of.Wick asks for her help, which despite having a marker refuses to do. The marker was for Wick getting her daughter to safety and away from the High Table. If she helps Wick she knows her daughter wouldn't be safe. Reluctantly she takes him to see Berrada (Jerome Flynn) and Wick asks for guidance as to where the High Table elder can be found. Berrada gives the information but at a price, one of Sofia's beloved dogs. Sofia refuses so Berrada shoots one as punishment.What follows is pure brutality and a high body count as both Wick and Sofia shoot, punch, stab and use her dogs to kill assailants on the streets of Casablanca and within the Continental.Having escaped into desert Sofia's marker is now complete and Wick must now walk through the desert alone and find elder in which he seeks a meeting with. On the edge of death a group of nomads find him and deliver him to who we now know is the elder. The elder asks what does Wick seek? What does he have to offer in return? All Wick wants is to remember his wife and to have the chance to love again.This the elder agrees to however on one condition, Wick must complete a task. That task being to kill Winston. If he does this then his contract will be cancelled and he will become an assassin again without the price on his head. Wick agrees and in return offers his wedding finger and ring in loyalty to the High Table.Meanwhile back in New York, the adjudicator returns to the Bowery King and asks whether he will stand down? He laughs in her face and again refuses to stand down. As punishment he must now receive 7 cuts for the 7 bullets and this is duly dealt with and we assume the King is dead.Wick has returned to New York, and is hunted down by the Japanese gang who turn out to be huge fans of Wick and this provides a few comedy moments within the film. Thankfully, Wick makes it back to the Continental and as the assailant is about to bring the sword down on Wick, the Concierge comes to his rescue and reminds everyone rules are rules and no man will be killed upon the grounds of the Continental.Wick seeks a meeting with Winston who upon meeting realises that Wick is here to kill him. The adjudicator turns up and asks Winston will he stand down? Which of course he refuses to do and will Wick kill Winston? Which of course he refuses to do. As a result of this the New York Continental is de-consecrated meaning anyone can be killed on the grounds and all rights and privileges offered by the High Table are no more.What follows is a huge gun fight involving Winston, Wick and the Concierge and a large body count with heads being blown off. There are some really great fight scenes involving Wick and the Japanese gang and just when you think Wick is down and out he kills the leader and wounds the others.The adjudicator calls a cease fire and Winston will get his hotel back with all of its privileges if he offers his undying loyalty to the High Table, which he duly does. However, not before killing Wick who falls from the roof on to the streets of New York. The adjudicator is suspicious and looks for the body of Wick but it has disappeared.It turns out the Bowery King is not dead after all and his group of underground vigilantes have taken Wick to meet him. This puts the wheels in motion for the 4th film rumoured to be out in 2021. The Bowery King is angry and wounded and wants revenge on the High Table and will Wick go after Winston for what he did?I really liked this film it is one of those where you can take your brain out and enjoy it for what it is. Halle Berry surprised me as well as she was pretty darn good in this film. Keanu Reeves must be one fit man as some of the fight scenes were brutal in terms of length.If you've seen the first two then you'll know what to expect from this film. Just go out there and enjoy it.",

He's just not believable and neither is the idea that he wouldn't kill Wick to easily solve the problem.Zero is also out of step with the mood. He injects humour into the scenes where the shouldn't be any and it ruins the flow of the scenes he's in.All in all, it could have been so much better, but it falls really flat.",

        "text": "Picking up right where Chapter Two left off, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) finds himself on the run from an open contract hit registered by his friends at the High Table. I kind of like the whole idea of an elite organization keeping it's members in line with the threat of 'excommunicado', but there were many examples of the hierarchy reversing course and failing to follow through. Like the Adjudicator (Asia Kate Dillon) giving Winston (Ian McShane) and the Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne) seven days to vacate their base of operations. And how about The Elder (Saïd Taghmaoui) offering Wick a position back under the High table if he fulfilled a hit on Winston. The premise of maintaining a very strict standard of conduct for the elite assassin's guild was repeatedly undermined in the story line, and created a departure from Chapter Two.As for the action, while at the same time I love it, have to admit that it gets so over the top that at times it becomes comical. Like the stable horses taking out Wick's assassins - priceless!! When Wick goes to Casablanca, it's the same old, same old after teaming with Halle Berry's character Sofia. With perfunctory breaks in the gun play to reload, the bullets keep flying and through it all, Wick and Sofia are practically invulnerable from the barrage of bullets flying their way, while the opposing body count mounts to triple digit proportions. It's so unrealistic that, as I say, you have to laugh after a while. Not to be outdone by Wick's fall from a high rise near the end of the story, smacking into fire escapes and plummeting to the pavement in as sure a way to die as any movie maker could come up with. And yet he survives! to set up the sequel that will be 'John Wick Four'.Look, there's no way you can take any of this seriously, and I think this 'Parabellum' excursion really took the story line into fantasy land. But if you like this stuff, and I do, it can be an entertaining two hour diversion to vicariously live the assassin's life and come out unscathed. Physically that is, mentally I'm not so sure.",

Now by all means is it not a clean action scene where you Won't tell it is a 50+ Keanu walking through a very choreographed fight. Sheesh! 75% of the shots were clear as day when telegraphing a strike.\nHale Berry was an unnecessary addition. So was the first act. This script is all over the place. I wasn't sure whether any of the exposition was important for his ties to a Russian smuggling ballet/sombo/smuggling ring since it only showed 15 minutes then was just tossed out like nothing. The over used \"dog\" line felt redundant and unnecessary. World building clearly was a thing Lionsgate is hoping for. Rather than rush details about the \"high table/under the table\" universal rules lets break it down at some point.\nThis movie was too soon, it clearly needed a better script/screen play/ stunt work/ story line/ and laws of what is capable.I liked the first John wick. It provided an almost mystery as to who this guy is and why it was a mistake to double cross him. They took that entity and made him the god damn terminator!!! Literally no risk to reward ratio. So the pay out seems predictable. Stabbed 15 times and no possibility of injury, falls off ten foot ceiling and gets up with no problem.\nJust an overall disappointing addition to the series and it seems like it's taking the place of what the \"Die Hard\" series once was, but it quickly follows that same train wreck.",

A plot that never changed and had no depth, simply a long string of ultimately boring fight scenes (yes fight scenes that are boring, that's gotta be hard to pull off).I was waiting for the twist, or some sort of sub-plot that would flesh out this film but it never came. I thought maybe when Halley Berry appeared that something would happen but nope just another fight scene but with more dogs added into the mix.Even the odd joke one liners were so badly timed that they felt awkward and never fresh or funny and acting was wooden from all but Ian McShane and even he could have done lots better.And the end, well it just seem to confirm that this film was just really a money grab and padding for the next JW4.\"You pissed john? are ya?\"\n\"Yeah......\"\n\"Yeah...... pissed at having wasted my time watching this film\"",

There basically is so much fighting that you easily start to notice stuntmen waiting for their turn to be hitted and it starts to remind you of a dance choreography than fighting. But with that said, it is really awesome to see Halle Berry and \"her\" dogs fight scenes! The most innovative scene of the whole movie!\nThat is what fills most of the movie.\nWhat is really missing is the story. The story does not really evolve. We are presented with some new characters but are missing all of the story behind them. I would have loved to know the story behind the first coin and contract. The story between Halle Berry and Keanu Reeves. The story behind \"The Elder\". All of this is overlooked for more endless fighting.\n... Keanu Reeves must be exhausted after this movie. Hope he doesn't take another 10 year \"break\".",

Keanu had put in lot of efforts to play his characters and we cab see his dedication and commitment on-screen, he displays the role of ruthless killer machine with an ease. Halle Berry introduced as Sofia is equally effective and stuns on screen, Asia Kate Dillon as strict adjudicator makes her presence felt, Ian McShane, Laurance Fishburne, Lance Reddick were good in their limited screen timing, Mark Dacascos was a unsung surprise package in his martial arts skills.Screenplay is very fast paced and a credit should be given to the director and screenplay writer that despite being a length of over 02 hours the movie doesn't looses it's grip. Action Scenes and the bike chase stunt needs special applause. background music is effective and backs the screenplay. Climax of close to 30 minutes is full of high octane action.This is a much needed and greatly made entry in the series which will give 'i am in heaven' feel to all the action lovers and a very special mention for Mark Dacascos and Halle Berry, hope to see Berry again reprising her role of dog lover brutal assassin in the coming part of the series.

The only good thing about the whole franchise is action, nothing more. everything else is PURE CRINGE.A curious thought: What do you think Jeff Bezos' reaction is to some of the premise? Would Bezos get off his couch for a measly 14 mil? Pocket change amirite? A small nothing from the taxes he didn't have to pay. This puts things in perspective. Is 14 mil worthy of all the fuss AROUND THE GLOBE? Hell no. These people are all acting high and mighty when they really are nobodys of the world.No seriously. It's a scam. Nobody gets the 14 (15) mil. The introduction of the Arab elder of the table was so underwhelming it made me laugh. That little tent from the desert was like the same one they used in Game of Thrones lmao. What the hell man, your servant's servant has nice castles lol.Oh the film is so cringy and stupid and CORNY.

Knives are thrown at him and they miss. I just couldn't get over all these things. And then the fall...come on... It's as if he was in the Matrix again. Needs more story and a little less killing.

In the first 2 films you could actually feel concern for the lead, but this one was just boring & the plot was thrown out the window with the script. The 1st film was great because the character was relatable due to losing a loved one & to kickstart the action his only memory of her is brutally killed (animal lovers can relate to this) so he goes out for revenge and it was GLORIOUS. The 2nd Chapter while not as good as the 1st was still a fun ride & gave some backstory to the John Wick universe & an antagonist we could HATE. The 3rd had none of this it was all over the place with its story & by the closing scene I am now burnt out on this franchise. Which is a shame as John Wick was the franchise that got me back into the cinema",

People who helped him is punished by the High Table. Continental is deconsecrated after Winston fails to step down and they fight back. Finally High Table and Continental reach a parley.\nSome people are pissed at the High Table for all this. Next film's mostly going to be about overthrowing the High Table.\nDialogue was so so cringy. Halle Berry, Keanu, GoT guy all got poor dialogues. I was laughing for most part, both the dialogue and its delivery was so cringy and funny. It felt like a video game snippet where characters talk but the dialogue is stiff.\nWalk in the desert with water 1/4th of bottle. Be in the verge of thirst and death and they will find you?? What nonsense! Felt like some fable told in ancient times.\nThe action sequences were good but some felt drawn out and could have been cut down. But hey I'm not complaining, some sequences at start were really good. Kudos to Keanu for doing the work and also to the director for keeping the camera on the action than cutting it up.\nAnd the ending. I don't care if JW is invincible in a fight, but if you fall from that height, no matter the sheets he bounce off, you are seriously seriously injured.I think maybe I am stupid to go to too much details, but the original movie had also a good plot along with the actions. The whole atmosphere was fresh.\nNow it's becoming just action and stupid dialogues.\nAre you pissed? Yeah, yeah",

I felt like John Wick 2 went heavy on story and missed the mark in some ways on some of the things that John Wick made so great but John Wick 3 brings it all back together. One fight after another, crazy stunts, brilliantly choreographed fighting ... it is exactly what you would expect coming to see this film. The reason why it's doing so well and getting the reviews it has been is because it fills expectations. You can't go into this knowing you're going to see a John Wick film and come out disappointed. It delivers in every way you can think of. Is it brilliant? No. It's really one fight after another with a very thin thread of a storyline that continues on from the first and second film and the entire character of Halle Berry seemed pointless to me and she also seemed to be just as immortal and unstoppable as John Wick is which makes no sense but in the end the film is a good time at the movies and delivers an exhilarating R-Rated experience. It throws back to the purposely violent films of the 80's while dabbling in this 1940's Detective/Gangster vibe while still keeping things completely fresh and stylistic. John Wick 3 will not disappoint fans of John Wick period. 8/10",

It's smooth, has interesting stuff (with horses, dogs...) and it, too, is a bit more realistic than before.The tries at comedic relief don't quite work well, but are not too bad (there's one gag that actually works). Hale Berry cameo is OK in general, but, not so good action wise. She's less smooth, and quite a bit more unrealistic than Keanu.There are also lost opportunities. Ian McShine's manager misses several opportunities to teach the millennials-era Adjudicator a few lessons that advanced wisdom from decades of doing a certain type of work bring. Essentially, this is done only once and is the above-mentioned one gag that really works.Also, near the end, the fights are less interesting and take a little too long. Sure, there's an idea why (opponents are the best), but, still, by that time, one is rather tired of watching Keanu fake-fight and kill people. It doesn't go overboard, but, could have been handled better.So, yeah, still a kind of tribute to the action movies of the 80's in a 10's look-and-feel and fundamentally different than the first two, nothing to really write home about, but, worth a watch.",

Sure he is technically a \"bad guy\" but that is what makes him so much more ruthless than a government agent. Bond has a license to kill, but when has he ever done so with such determined abandon as Wick has done in all three of his films? And bad guy or not, he has a heart of gold.While I doubt Bond will be done any time soon, I feel the brand has run it's course. That it survived the end of the cold war is amazing since Bond was indeed a cold war agent; but now it is time to say goodbye James.",

        "text": "Punch, shoot, kick. Wash, rinse, and repeat...for a third time. The first movie wasn't anything particularly original but it was a master class in fight choreography and stunts. Nothing much else, just that. The second merely gave us more of the same with a slightly beefed-up plot. Again nothing particularly original but it actually got more confusing. Now we have the third (but not final) entry. And once again its simply more of the same only ratcheted up to another level and with the plot getting even more convoluted.Continuing from where the sequel left off sees Wick basically in deep doo doo for the unauthorised killing of a High Table crime lord and for doing it within the Continental Hotel. He has merely one hour before being labelled excommunicado and therefore open season to every bounty hunter in the world, literally. What follows is essentially a long drawn-out chase flick as Wick must escape America to find the Elder (the highest rank in this world of assassins) and get his hit status revoked. That's basically it, nothing more.OK so the first movie was a solid gritty revenge flick. The second movie expanded a few ideas which was nice but it got slightly ridiculous and became CGI heavy. Now this third movie goes above and beyond into the realms of nonsense as far as I'm concerned. The first thing that bugs me is how insane this world has become since the first movie. We're now in a situation where Wick literally cannot turn a corner without some random gang of thugs trying to kill him. If not on foot then roaming motorbike gangs. The movie moves from one set piece to the next without any real sense of reality anymore, it's like a showreel. There don't appear to be any normal people in the city, no police, no emergency services etc...Fights break out, people are killed, blood gushes everywhere, no one bats an eye. Where are the police??? Do the High Table control the cops?Granted most of the fights are still well done but with this being the third movie things are getting a tad repetitive...and daft. In one early fight Wick and his enemies just happen to stumble into some kind of museum full of weapons behind glass, lots of glass. As said we get more motorbike jousting, and speaking of jousting Wick actually fights on horseback this time too. Original yes, but signs of desperation for originality? Yup. Still not sure what this place was in the middle of New York that had an open stable. I also failed to see how the bad guys couldn't bring Wick down when they were on motorbikes.Another issue with the fighting was once again the heavy use of CGI for almost all blood. I understand that it's probably more cost effective instead of using actual live squibs but boy does it look crap. That's the difference between old action flicks and modern ones. Then add to that the simple fact that Wick is nigh on invincible no matter who he fights or how badly injured he is which I just can't get on with. Plus I just can't believe how useless everyone is in this movie. No matter who the bad guys are they are useless, depending on the scene. All the bounty hunters are useless. All the elite High Table henchmen are useless. All the elite assassins are essentially useless but manage to offer somewhat of a battle. All the Continental Hotel men are useless. You'd think the Continental staff would be badass all things considered, nope. Oh yeah and when the hotel is announced as deconsecrated it was full of people, next scene its empty! Apart from a handful of useless staff members. You'd think there would have been many more staff members ready to defend the premises. And when I say useless I mean Stormtrooper levels of useless, no matter how much weaponry they have.How come the top echelons/the Elder of the High Table are a bunch of Arabs in a tent in the middle of a desert? Seemed a bit random. I'm guessing this entire sect of assassins possibly dates back to the medieval period? Twas also amusing how Wick managed to survive walking through said desert without any food or water to find said echelons too. Before that we got some pointless scenes with Halle Berry, in an obvious Caucasian wig, as an old friend of Wick who helps him get info from some other pointless character to find the Elder (seemed like totally drawn out filler). Essentially this was just an excuse to have a strong female character fight sequence...because equality. This merely exposed how bad these fight sequences can be when you have someone who doesn't really do movies like this much (the fight choreography becomes obvious). It was also an excuse to add some dog action in there which was also stupid because how did those dogs not get shot??And finally, yawn! We get a big fight sequence between Wick and yet more so-called elite assassins from the High Table led by Zero (Mark Dacascos). This tiresome affair takes place in some hall of mirrors setup or something. It's an entire floor within a skyscraper made of glass, for no apparent reason. But you can guess one thing, its decked out with tonnes of glass just right for throwing people through, ugh! Clearly using ideas from Bruce Lee. I should also point out that The Bowery King (Lawrence Fishburne) is back again simply to set up the story for the inevitable fourth movie.And thusly in the end we go right back to where we started. Winston and co help Wick, the High Table seem to give up and offer a deal, Winston seemingly betrays Wick to save his place of power within the hotel. So does this mean it's back to Wick versus everyone yet again? Possibly, although I'm sure Winston and co are merely covering their true intentions and will possibly help Wick in taking down the entire High Table organisation (with the help of Lawrence Fishburne's artful dodger types) in the fourth outing.So yeah, I don't really get the hype over this franchise. Probably because I firmly believe it shouldn't have become a franchise. The first movie was a simply gritty affair, it didn't need any more, it didn't need milking (think 'Taken'). But since then we've gotten two more movies and they have taken the whole idea into this inane videogame-esque world where reality has gone out the window. Sure it looks pretty and the fights still look good (for the most part), but this is the third movie people, and they're doing another one! Geez!5/10",

So they have no idea what to do with a movie that is legitimately a 6 or a 7. A movie that is \"just fine\". The biggest issue is that this feels a lot like it is just moving the pieces along to where they need to be for Chapter 4. That being said the action is still good. The production value is still good. And the world building is still the most interesting thing about the series. The introduction of The Adjudicator played with proper menace by Asia Kate Dillion is among the most interesting of the new characters. That all being said this is still worth the watch in the hope that Chaotsr 4 brings it all together.",

        "text": "Many Thanks to that stupid who stole John Wick's car and killed his dog. Thanks to him, John came back from retirement and now is killing everybody. The action is at such high magnitude and everything feels so real, unlike most action movies nowadays. The second fight scene with the knives was so hilariously brutal. Personally I actually like the John Wick franchise better than the Mission Impossible franchise. For whatever reason the action in it appeals way more to me. The scene with the dogs is easily a top 5 action scene of all time. And the judo throws were amazing. Halle Berry was really good, I'd pay to see a spinoff with her character she is The most wasted talent when it comes to these type of movies imo. She's got it all, especially that she actually looks like she could throw a big guy through a window. Like the saying, all the right curves in all the right place's. So glad she's in this movie. John Wick promised a lot... and delivered. It was great to watch and the action was awesome. I hope all people involved come together and continue this saga. I think that the second John Wick was more beautiful shot, regarding colors and styling. But the action was even better than ever before. Halle Berry was incredible and the dogs so scary.. BUT! It is only a small one the sequenze in the desert had fallen a little flat. It wasn't so exciting and interesting also the public's reaction to murder being totally weird. There are several instances where people are killed in very public places and very gruesome ways and no one seems to care Ruin the immersion a bit. But this is my only point of critique. When he teamed up with Halle Berry I didn't want it to stop. the fight scenes were amazing to watch, beautifully choreographed and for the most part believable. I too noticed a couple of times when actors were waiting to be thrown or punched but it's easy to give them a pass for that. Btw I think this is the best film out of the three. I felt the first one had the great story but a weak ending. I thought the second had a weaker story and a great ending. And in this one, although it was a tad too long and I did feel that fatigue in moments, I think it had the best combination of story and nailing the ending. Plus it has the best action sequences by far.",

I rewatched them yesterday just to be up to date and even at second viewing the action was still cool and the story still thrilling.Now I just came back from cinema and I am very, very sad, but:For me this might be the most boring movie I have ever seen in my life. And it makes me incredibly sad.\nI didn't go in expecting a storytelling masterpiece, I went in expecting a fun action thriller, but what I got was a repetitive bloodshed 50% of the movie, and an exceptionally not-believeable story line paired with really bad acting by Asia Kate Dillon.\nI went in expecting a creative action blockbuster that makes sense and builds on the foundation laid by previous chapters. They repeatedly mention \"consequences\", but nothing in this movie has consequences. It starts with John Wick going on a weird journey to some dude who tells him about some other dude who hides in the desert and that dude then for some reason gives him a second chance if he kills Winston? But why? They also show us how the Bowery king gets killed but then hes not dead. How? They also tell us that Winston has to step back, but then after John kills 50 dudes he gets his power back. Why?\nNothing in this movie has consqeuences.\nWe have seen John get hit by cars in previous movies and it was unbelievable then but this movie brings it to a whole new level. Two cars run him over and it just doesn't matter. He doesn't even bling.\nAnd then there are these tweo dudes in one of the end fights who had John on the ground but help him up again and then they keep fighting. Why?\nThe only difference between the start of the movie and the outcome is this: Winston and John are no longer allies I suppose and the bowery king helps John again. That's litereally it.But the main problem is: The action sequences got boring REALLY quickly.I really wanted to love this movie, but I just couldn't. I am glad if you did.",

He did at least stand out from the cannon fodder. But John Wick still should have died to wrap this saga up.",

In most fight scenes Wick can barely get two his feet with any semblance of speed or dexterity and looks awfully wobbly and disorientated when the fights continue as he defends himself and there is more. Don't get me wrong I love the series just some of the realism is missing.

Both 2 and 3 are nothing but a string of brutal action scenes with almost no connective tissue. You know, story and characters, that kind of thing.If you haven't seen 1 AND 2 shortly before having seen 3 you are essentially f'd, because 3 begins in medias res and offers no explanation or background to what's going on. Which only shows that the story doesn't really matter.There is very little difference between the sequels and those porn videos where only the money shots are strung together. The sequels shouldn't even be regarded as movies. They are stunt reels. There is no need to view the whole thing in one sitting, you might just as well chop it into 10 minute Youtube clips.John Wick must clearly be using an aimbot, because there is headshot after headshot after headshot. Do people know how insanely hard it is to hit something as small as a head (and a moving one at that) at a distance?He has also enabled god mode, because in the sequels he's an immortal. He gets shot, stabbed, punched and kicked a million times without real consequence. Not to mention falling off the roof of a tall building, smacking into fire escapes and awnings on the way before landing on the asphalt with a thud. Perhaps he'll wince for five seconds, but then Johnny's back to fighting like a champ.This also means that there is no sense of peril, effectively removing all tension no matter how spectacular the choreography is.Judging from the sequels neither New York, nor Rome or Casablanca have any police. But that's not the only weird thing about this universe. When they're fighting in the library, people are sitting five meters away reading with any reaction whatsoever. When three people are brutally stabbed to death in the middle of a train station. People mill about without even flinching. Is the twist in 4 that John Wick and this whole under-the-table organization I couldn't care less about are ghosts?The acting is also on par with porn. The new woman playing the auditor is a perfect match with Keanu Reeves, because they have the exact same emotional range, which is none. And listen to this writing:\"After this we'll be even.\"\"No, after this we'll be LESS than even.\"What does this even mean?? Who wrote this??Halle Berry is thrown into the second act for some reason, but she has no bearing on the story. You could lift her scenes from the movie and it would be exactly the same.Why do all women working for the organization look like Rosie the Riveter-style hipsters? Why do the filmmakers still think that tattoos are associated with shadowy figures?My god, these sequels are a waste of time.",

And before the High Table was fully revealed, we've got a mysterious Elder... who ended up being quite underwhelming. Let's also remember that the first two installments have a nice plot.Below are my random thoughts on the various fight scenes, YMMV.The library fight:\nBoring.The knife-throwing fight:\nEntertaining, brutal, the best.The horse fight:\nThe first kick was super fun. The second and third? Just beating a dead horse.The ballet fight (no Wick):\nThis was my favourite scene from the movie.\nNo, not the assassinations. The actual ballet.\nIt's super cool, so was the music!The dog fight:\nWay too long. With the franchise being all practical and tactical, Halle Berry was there standing out in the open, not getting shot at, while her dogs played around with dicks. They hired Navy Seals to be personal trainers but not choreographers?The Morpheus fight (no Wick):\nBy now the Asian gang has been built up to be way too OP for John Wick to take on alone. Let's hope they won't dumb down the final fight(s) with these awesome Asians... (spoiler: nope.)\nAnother spoiler: Sword master Zero did a very poor job of slicing Morpheus.\nBtw 7 cuts? I counted 6.The motorcycle chase:\nFor a gang of swordsmen specialized in close-quarter combat and subterfuge, they decided to chase after Wick in motorcycles...The Continental fight:\nMajor disappointment.\nWinston suggested Wick to hunt, but there were very few ambush from Wick.\nThe armour was a nice obstacle, bullets were used to delay attackers rather than killing them, but then that made those direct fights in the open illogical. I don't recall Wick getting shot despite his suit.\nThe hotel staff were cannon fodders. Again, standing out in the open, on their own turf! No ambush, no traps? And the Continental didn't provide those \"nice suits\" to their own staff? Such unnecessary deaths.\nBest scene in this part of the movie, and I believe the director wanted you to notice, was the underwater bullets.The boss fight(s):\nAny one of the three would have been sufficient. But all three in sequential order... not so much. Don't try to be Bruce Lee.\nBringing a gun to a sword fight and not using it; bring a sword to a fist fight and not using it...\nAside from the two Indonesian masters who did not intend to kill Wick, the others were supposed to want him dead, right?\nBy the way kudos for featuring Indonesian martial arts.\nFrankly it's hard to believe ambushing would work in a glass room, let alone vanishing into thin air.\nWick has been to this room before! Shouldn't he be aware of potential hiding spots?\nIt's nice to see Wick learning from his opponents quickly.See you in Chapter 4.",

        "text": "Hurtling through the astonishingly violent John Wick 3: Parabellum, the third installment of Chad Stahelski's successful series starring Keanu Reeves as the titular character, I was confused as to whether I was watching a movie or whether I was in some sort of VR video game walkthrough, so immersive was the experience. In the Blade Runner-esque dystopian metropolis of the film, professional hitman, Wick, has killed a member of the so-called \"High Table\", the international assassins' guild, and, consequently, has a sizeable bounty on his head. Thus, the bulk of the film is devoted to Wick as the running target, combating fellow assassins which come at him left, right, and centre.It has been some time since I watched the first and second John Wick films, but even with my hazy memory of them, I know they came off much better than this third outing, which is basically for lovers of superfluous violence. However, I have to concede that the special effects which enabled this eye-watering violence were visually impressive. Perhaps it didn't help that the cinema in which I was watching the film was blasting intolerably loud Dolby Digital 7.1 surround sound into my lugholes. (That's slang for ears, by the way...). The script, in many cases, is very thin, and some of the one-liners could have been penned by a 10 year old, particularly the last one of the movie, delivered by Reeves himself. He does what he does best - acting in a typically wooden manner, and erstwhile Bond girl, Halle Berry, appears as John's aid in his mission, before swiftly disappearing. I hope she was paid well for what was pitifully small screen time.Finally, the only redeeming features of the film, in my eyes, were the small, comical appearances by British actor, Ian McShane, of television's Lovejoy, who has found some success in American cinema, it has to be said. Though, admittedly, even he looked a bit jaded. Perhaps it's time to hang up your weapons, and all-black attire, Mr. Wick?",

This one seemed slower at times but the action scenes get better with every movie and this one does not disappoint. You see John Wick fight on horseback like a modern day horseman of death, on a motorcycle zoomin' and shootin' fools, and underwater where the bullets are drastically slowed. There is even a badass knife throwing fight and also an epic sword duel. The senseless violence is brutal and just so freakin awesome and realistic! Also, there are some Matrix references in this movie besides Lawrence Fishburne teaming up again, we get the old \"how about I give you the finger line\", and the\"I need guns, lots of guns\" line! Keanu Reeves is a true badass because he still does his own stunts and knows actual fighting and gun techniques. Halle Berry appears in this film as well, and she actually comes across as an absolute badass as well! **Spoiler** She has these two attack dogs that are vicious and follow her every command! Great action film per usual, and one hell of a ride. John Wick will return more pissed off than ever!P.S. **Spoiler** All I could think of when the Sushi Samurai guy was chasing John Wick was them playing a game of tag, especially when John Wick put his hand on the Continental stairs and the guy couldn't touch him because he was safe so to speak.",

        "text": "This third episode continues with the good production values, the stylish sets, and the large body counts. While watching, I asked myself if the violence (volume and type) needs to be such an integral part of the story. Like Bruce Lee in \"Enter the Dragon\", Wick takes on hordes of attackers, but he doesn't just put them on their backs. He shoots them, shoots them again, and then goes back to shoot them again for good measure. And this type of action is the centerpiece of the film.Obviously this is a film intended for adults. My guess is that the audience includes plenty of younger people. And many of them listen to music that glorifies violence and the worst impulses. And I believe John Wick could be a hero without the non-stop mayhem. What if he made a point of bypassing all the henchmen (through stealth) and took out the top of the organization that was after him? There could still be car chases and other action sequences. He could still be a man with a moral code. He could still be a cool dude.Others have written that this film is just more of the same. That is true to some extent. And it would be more interesting if Wick had to evolve. A character arc is just as important as a story arc. We see some change in Wick, but mostly he is struggling to remain the same.I liked the Halle Berry character. It would have been interesting if she had continued on in the story, fighting alongside Wick. And the concept of an adjudicator is smart. The ballet school was a nice touch. Most of the characters are well-developed. There are many good things about the film, but the best sequels are those that surprise the viewer with unexpected changes in story or character.",

        "text": "Apparently, this is starting to look a lot like a franchise, depending on how well this movie does at the box office of course. Apparently Keanu has suggested that he will keep making John Wick films until people stop going and seeing them. Well, I have seen three so far, and it seems that they always end not so much on a cliff hanger, but with a teaser leaving room for a possible continuation (though this wasn't necessarily the case with the first movie).So, this film begins where the previous film ended (which was also the case with the beginning of the previous film, though not necessarily the first film because, well, it was the first film). We have John Wick, and his dog, running through New York with something like every assassin waiting for the count down to end so that they can kill him and attempt to collect the $14 million bounty. However, this is John Wick, so as is suggested, the odds of him surviving are pretty much even.\nLook, I'm not actually sure if there is actually a plot in this film, as it seems to have fallen into a category of 'an episode' and really only deals with John's attempt to try and get his name cleared, or more specifically the bounty removed from his head. The catch is, that this isn't the case of an innocent person attempting to prove himself innocent, but a guilty person attempting to escape the punishment he deserves.I guess that is one of the problems with this film, namely its episodic nature - the film begins at a position which clearly indicates that there was something that came before, and ended in a position that gave it room for there to be another chapter at a later date. This means that one simply cannot just come into this film without actually watching the other two, and further, one does need to be a little familiar with what happened previously to understand why the film actually starts with Wick running, and why he has become incommunicado.One of the interesting features though is the world in which it is set. It is a world where the criminal organisations live by a code, and there is an authority that basically rules over them. Further, there is also their own currency which they use. However, the thing about this film is that it is an action film through and through, and it basically never lets up. However, one of the major problems is that you do get to a point where simply watching somebody killing mooks does get a little boring, as is the case here.",

It is very rare and difficult for action films to be entertaining and intelligent at the same time - almost an impossible task ; John Wick 3 achieves this impossible task, and exceeds all the expectations that were set.The main reason for the success of John Wick 3 is the great understanding between main actor Keanu Reeves and the director Chad Stahelski . This great actor-director duo /team must be remembered and noted as legendary ; just like other legendary actor-director combos such as Al Pacino-Francis Ford Coppola, Robert De Niro-Martin Scorsese, Christian Bale- Christopher Nolan and so on.This movie delights action fans to the maximum satisfaction level - there is almost uninterrupted action throughout this movie. However, in doing so, the director has not compromised the story-telling and continuity. In fact, the story and John Wick's character deepen further. The viewers are provided with new information about John Wick. The director and writers have presented a brilliant character study in the form of John Wick (a.k.a. Boogeyman).Keanu Reeves has once again given a great, dark, mesmerizing, and memorable performance as the super-assassin John Wick. He shines in every scene in this movie. This is the role, the character, and the performance that must be classified as Keanu's best work. Keanu has been successful in other action films / roles earlier - such as the honest officer in \"Speed\", Neo in \" The Matrix\" ; but the way he has played John Wick is simply outstanding. I love the way Keanu Reeves has given a dark, dangerous portrayal as John Wick for the third time. This is one movie franchise that has become better with each new entry in the franchise.",

JOHN WICK featured Keanu Reeves in the title role as a hit man who comes out of retirement when a Russian mob boss's son kills his dog, a pet left to him by his recently deceased wife, and steals his car. In the world of movies this is an absolute no no. We learned about the world of hitmen in this film, their codes of honor and the secret locations around the world that are safe haven against any and all retribution. John arrives at The Continental and while there he is supposed to be safe. But all good plans as they say. In the end he extracted his revenge.The second film taking place 4 days after the first finds Santino, a crime lord, who turns in his marker held by Wick. Once more he comes out of retirement but this time around he's being played. By the end of the film he's crossed the line killing the mob boss inside the Continental. This sets in motion a bounty placed on Wick's head at the end of the film for any and all willing to try and collect.Which brings us to JOHN WICK 3: PARABELLUM just released this week. If you haven't seen the first two films don't take my descriptions of them to get you up to date. Buy them both. For movie fans it's a worthwhile investment. As with the last time around this movie picks up minutes after the ending of the last film. Wick is on the run and doing his best to remain alive as the hired killers from around the world are tracking him down to collect the $14 million bounty on his head. Wick turns to a woman who raised him known as the Director (Angelica Huston) to provide him aid which she does.The secret organization that rules over all of these killers is called the High Table. The Adjudicator (Asia Kate Dillon) of the High Table arrives at the New York Continental and chastises the owner, Winston (Ian McShane) for allowing Santino to be killed on the premises. She gives him and the Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne) 7 days to get their affairs in order and give up their offices. She then hires a Japanese assassin known as Zero (Mark Dacascos) to take care of Wick.In the meantime Wick has made his way to Casablanca where he seeks the aid of Sofia (Halle Berry), an old friend and the manager of the Casablanca Continental. Another marker is called in and she agrees to help him. After much carnage and more dead bodies than one can easily count, the pair head off to the desert to find the Elder, the highest ranking member of the High Table. To earn back his freedom Wick must agree to kill Winston, a man who helped him many times in the past, and to continue being a killer for hire the rest of his life.There are several things you need to know about this franchise before going in. It is incredibly violent, the body counts are astronomical and they are tremendously fun. I know, that seems odd when you consider the number of people killed in these films. But they are pure escapism with enough story to hold your interest and enough action to have your palms sweating while watching.More amazing than anything else is that each films just ups the ante and never lets go. Each movie moves at a full throttle pace and doesn't stop. When you begin to catch your breath in one scene the next begins and you're wondering just what will happen to those you already know will be little more than victims of Wick's revenge. Watching the films is like riding on a roller coaster that seems to always be cresting the top and dropping you down with little recovery time.While this type of film is usually found only in low budget flicks that feature actors of lesser stature the Wick films feature actors that are still at the top of their game and work circles around the subject matter. In particular Reeves has taken a character we should dislike because of his previous occupation as a hired gun but we sympathize with him and his predicament due to the circumstances. He is the quintessential anti-hero of the decade and the boogey man one hopes to never meet. Fishburne is excellent here as well and it is great to see him alongside Reeves in both the second film as well as this one. The two made history with their starring in THE MATRIX films and do so again here. And McShane is so much fun to watch here adding just a touch of humor to the mix.Don't think of this film as reality. It isn't, far from it. But it is one non-stop assault on the senses that will have you stunned at moments and reaching for the remote to back up and watch certain segments over again due to the speed at which they take place. Short of movies being made in China and Korea you will find few action films that move at this pace in both story and fight sequences. One spoiler alert. The film leaves it open for another Wick film. As for myself I can hardly wait until it arrives.",

        "text": "I know enough about writing to understand WHY this movie was terrible. How do terrible writers get hired to create atrocities like this??1. NO PLOT. John Wick spends most of the movie with the meager motivation to stay alive, even if it costs the lives of HUNDREDS of other low-life thugs just like him. We are supposed to believe his life is worth it, simply because he used to be happily married. However, even John doesn't seem convinced that his life is worth saving. One goon insists that he and Wick are \"the same\". (SO CLICHE it hurts) but John unconvincingly insists they aren't the same. He goes through the mind-numbing motions of killing, just like a robot. One source counts 299 people killed so far in this franchise. That's 299 mothers who lost their adult sons and daughters. Countless brothers and sisters, spouses, children, friends, etc who are grieving the loss of these faceless punching bag goons. Their deaths have no meaning, because the audience just isn't convinced that John's life is worth saving.2. NO CHARACTER ARC. In the first movie, we had an opportunity to see John's character arc move, as he struggles with the loss of his wife, finds hope in the puppy, then loses what little hope he enjoyed... only to regain hope as he fights to get back what he lost. When he adopts a new dog at the end of John Wick 1, the audience gets a nice feeling of satisfaction, knowing that he has found a reason to live. HOWEVER.... in both John Wick 2 and 3, the writers didn't bother to show any significant character arc development. John Wick 2 had at least the motivation of revenge for the death of a friend, even though it was portrayed unconvincingly. John Wick 3 didn't even bother with character arcs.3. PROTAG REACTS instead of initiates. A good story has the protagonist driving the action and working towards a clear goal. In John Wick 3, the protag spends most of his time reacting to people who chase him or con him into protecting a dumb hotel. He takes initiative to go to the Russians, but it's really just part of his reaction to being chased. He seeks out \"the one above the table\", but again, the protag is flowing with the current as Halle Berry's character takes him along for a ride and dumps him in the desert. He doesn't drive any action when he finally meets \"the one above the table\", but again responds to this person's demands. When his \"friend\" convinces John not to follow through w the execution, John is AGAIN reacting.4. TIRED. The tone of the movie is supposed to be fast paced, BUT the emotional tone is \"tired\". John is tired of being chased, he appears emotionally tired of killing people, his few lines of dialogue are lethargic. His character lacks the EMOTIONAL energy of John Wick 1. The mismatch between action energy and emotional energy can be a great intentional tool, but only when we are given a solid character arc that gives meaning to the incongruity. John Wick lacks that meaning.5. PROTAG IS UNLIKABLE/unrelatable. John takes other people's lives like it means nothing... and, to the audience, it really means nothing. We are supposed to celebrate each kill based on the assumption that the audience is deeply invested in John's goal to stay alive. However, we weren't invested, because John's life looks pretty pathetic at this point. He puts others in danger (Halle's character) and takes other lives just to save his own skin. Sadly, the writers didn't bother to take time and prove to the audience WHY we should celebrate each of John's victories. An unlikable/unrelatable protag can work well, of course, but only if the audience is investing in finding out what happens next or believes in the protag's cause/goal.6. NOTHING FRESH. By the third movie in a series, an audience expects higher stakes. The writers foolishly imagined that showing a higher and higher bounty would convince the audience that the stakes were greater. This isn't how humans work. We are social creatures, and our expectations for a protagonist is that this \"hero\" will eventually fight for a cause greater than himself. (see Simon Sinek's work, \"Leaders Eat Last\") The first movie worked well enough, because Wick was fighting his internal grief as well as external enemies. However, the next two movies just didn't effectively raise the stakes.7. SETUPS w no PAYOFF. There were numerous interesting opportunities (which felt like setups) to dig into John's past and learn more about why we should care for his survival. Who raised him? Who taught him to fight? What enticed (or forced) him into this life? He did a favor for Halle Berry's character, and her character teased us with possible setups and unanswered questions. Instead she disappears and we are stuck with the boring climax as the hotel. No real payoffs.8. PREDICTABLE AND BORING \"TWIST\". The big \"twist\" is that the hotel manager who claims to be John's friend ends up turning on John. It's predictable: there is not really any emotional reaction to this \"betrayal\", because their relationship was never well established.",

        "text": "\"Guns. Lots of guns\". You tell em' Keanu and the underused Halle Berry. The movie I'm about to review is \"armed\" and far from being \"gun-shy\".Anyway, badass hit man John Wick now has a $14 million dollar bounty on his head. That's all because he killed a member of the international assassin's guild (it's no longer about a wife and a dead dog people). Everyone from New York City to Morocco is out to get John and he must use his special skills (and swanky suits) to defeat them.Keanu Reeves plays Wick with a familiar screen presence, a flax of physicality, and a comparable way in which he hastily reloads a Walther P99. In all validity, Reeves seems to be steadily reinventing himself as an action star and it's a beautiful thing. Yeah, that's the gist of John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum (my latest write-up).Set in a fantasy world full of Spaghetti Western nods, cardboard liquidators, old school phone operators, pilot subtitles, and flux swordsmen, \"Chapter 3\" feels like a 130-minute, junkie bone-crunching sermon. Yeah there's a smidgen of a mumbo jumbo plot but it's more about the relentless melee here.\"Chapter 3's\" director (Chad Stahelski) moves his camera around like a mild typhoon, letting everything spill out a la a bleeding video game. As for Reeves, well he's like Stahelski's almost indestructible muse. Basically Keanu makes Jet Li and even the late Bruce Lee look like Mister Rogers in comparison.In conclusion, John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum isn't the best of the John Wick series (that honor goes to Chapter 2) but it's easily the most violent and most kung fu-ed. Call it \"crouching tiger, hidden\" Keanu. Call it \"enter the\" Keanu. Call it the Keanu \"identity\". Yup, it's a \"wick\" that still burns rightly and brightly. The question is will it burn enough with a 4th installment coming around the corner (hint, hint)? My rating: 3 stars.",

I can understand if Wick survived gunshoot, knife slash and all that bone wrencing fight, but falling from aproximately 7th floor, hitting 2 iron bars before finally hit the ground and not dead, its just too much for me. You can make the scene as simple as He take the gun shoot and not dead, that will be far more acceptable.",

        "text": "John Wick is proving itself to be a masterful franchise in action cinema; it takes gun-fu, martial arts and car-chases to a whole new level. Its neon lighting is spectacular and its balancing of spectacle with the story is further proof that these films can make its action sequences relevant to the main character's arc and not just serve as substance-less eye-candy. John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is like poetry written with bullets and blood, and I can't wait to see where this series goes from here (if there is anywhere to go from here). It's fast-paced, cuts to the chase and no-nonsense with driving its characters into unparalleled danger.As the bookend chapter of a trilogy it wraps up its arcs very nicely and seamlessly. I love how this series deals with a hit-man desperate to survive and uses EVERYTHING at his disposal as weaponry in a never-ending arsenal for Keanu Reeves' spiritual successor to his iconic take on Neo in The Matrix movies. John Wick is like Travis Bickle mixed with Batman, James Bond, John McClane and Leon the Professional. This guy could possibly beat the crap out of Solid Snake and Sam Fisher if he were given the right opportunity (perhaps even Jason Bourne as well?).This film is a beauty filled to the brim with action and tension around every corner. It's what bad action movies want to be, and what movies of its ilk strive to be in the end: locked and loaded fun that doesn't pad out its sequences with talky baggage, just cut to the chase and don't make the script stretch things unnecessarily.John Wick 3 is fantastic!",

        "text": "I admit that I enjoyed the first one, and the second one wasn't too bad. The first two movies of this series had pretty solid story lines based on possible reality and loads of violent fighting. This is not like the first two. Yes, there is violent fighting ... actually, this movie bumps up the duration of violent fighting to the point that the watcher realizes that this movie is was only written to have a platform for lots of violent fighting ... or call it fantasy video game fighting ... where none get tired, especially not the hero, and the attackers just keep on coming, as if it was a zombie apocalypse or Captain America taking out the whole kung-fu nation, one person at a time. One fight simply moves on to the next fight as the hero must move down the fixed path, conquering each new level group of bad guys in hand to hand combat or modern video game shooting gallery. The only things missing from the video game were pauses for re-arming, tokens given to get help journeying along the way, a guru-mastermind running everything who must be spoken to, and more fights to get back ... oh, maybe those weren't missing. I admit that the fights were so long and utterly predictable that I Fast-Forwarded through them. Then there was the fantasy aspect, where the enemy knew everything, all of the time, the characters refusing to re-write the monotonous script by \"taking-out\" the oft repeated messenger of doom who would have been powerless if dealt with. And where was even one grenade or set of bombs to save the hero from individual \"take-downs\". I gave it a 6 only because the choreographer had to work so hard with so much fighting, but the story line is really a 2 or 3. If you have a brain, you will save it for a movie that requires a brain.",

Leading to a martial arts duel that literally pulls no punches!And that's just the opening sequence.What follows is a two-hour-long roller coaster ride with Keanu Reeves, as John, calling in old markers owed him so he can get himself smuggled to Morocco, North Africa, for an audience with The Elder. The mysterious Chairperson of the High Table. He wants to plead his case before the guy. But, again, he has to make a diabolical bargain in order to buy himself some time. And therein lies the motivation for all the violent chaos that follows.In addition to all the regular characters returning from the first two movies, we also have new faces in the form of Angelica Huston (actress-daughter of legendary director John Huston) as someone who divulges another fascinating piece of John's pre-martial back story. Followed by Mark Dacascos, martial arts movie actor extraordinaire, as a sushi-restaurateur/ ninja leader. Emphasis on the slash!This is why I can't wait for JW4. The writers for these first three films have proven well worth the money paid for their vivid imaginations. As they have delivered one great plot twist after another. For example: the High Table showing itself to be composed of power-hungry hypocrites no better than Santino D'Antonio. Were they grateful that John eliminated a potential threat to their sovereignty? Nope! All they're concerned with is that he broke the letter of their precious \"rules.\"Rules that apparently can never have _any_ exceptions allowed. And, for that, John and the Bowery King are going to make them pay.",

John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is directed by Chad Stahelski, produced by Basil Iwanyk, Erica Lee, and stars Keanu Reeves. The movie takes place immediately after the end of John Wick: Chapter 2 with John Wick being excommunicated and fleeing New York City.John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is a great action movie. The movie has great action that characterizes the entire series. This movie does not let up for a single moment in the 131 minutes of running time. Of note, the movie has interesting set pieces that differ from those that were seen in the previous movies. This is great as the action still feel unique with John Wick resorting to other weapons besides firearms. Some of the highlights to the action include a stable fight, a motorcycle escape, and desert shootout.The world of John Wick feels less fresh as it did in the past installments. The third installment in the series does not have any new surprises. The concepts that were introduced in John Wick: Chapter 2 are explored more here. Some of the new characters includes someone that owes John Wick a blood marker, the adjudicator, and the Elder of the High Table. These concepts are interesting to see play out but they are nothing new.The interesting development is that the characters that were introduced in the previous chapter actually become important in this movie. The Bowery King introduced in the previous movie has a small arc in this movie and it sets up the next movie perfectly. I enjoyed how this was planned out with it beginning in John Wick: Chapter 2. The movie does awesomely in preserving the spirit of the characters and developing them further by the end. Winston, the owner of the Continental Hotel has an interesting choice at the end of the movie. This choice has me excited for the future of the series.I highly recommend 'John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum'.Grade: A",

There is no storyline...just that he is fighting to safe his life, duh we knew that when chapter 2 ended that he would be fighting for his life! Why didn't they storyline it to go after the high table and do a change of power? Or become part of the table as a progressive example of coming from nothing and making it out on top above the odds; there was so much story that they could have added to this and instead it's just...f.i.g.h.t.i.n.g for his life. To say the least my husband fell asleep watching the movie. We kept saying when is the fighting going to stop? Now we are probably going to have to hope that chapter 4 maybe a fight to come after the table (rolling my eyes)**What killed it even more.... the Chinese dude with a long sword in his chest gets up to talk....really!!!!",

        "text": "Maybe it is easy to critic a hard work, but comparing to the previous two, I feel sorry about how they made this chapter.In 2014, the first JW came out as an explosion to me. It was an excellent movie from almost every point (in case I miss any). A very touching story between John and Helen, a legendary story of the Baba Yaga. The story started from touching the limit of a prof. assassin. This one has very clean fighting scenes, ruthless, efficient, no hesitation, totally lives up to the characteristic of John they tried to make. The end was also good that with a little twist.The second chapter was also good. John was forced back to business. Somehow the part of Helen was ignored in this chapter but the good thing is they maintained the quality of shooting and fighting scenes, which somewhat compensates the weak story line from the emotional perspective.But this one? I can see that they try to put the story line of Helen back again but they did it in a way very awkward by mentioned Helen's name at several points which are not necessary. They increased the weight of fight scene, like the typical Hollywood style, which is fine. What disappoints me was they made them in such a bad way, like the typical Hollywood style as well! If you are a fan of martial art action movie, I am sure you will notice those bad guys wait to be cued in inside the camera (in the background) and they made it so obvious. The motor chase was also badly made. In my opinion, those motor guys were there doing nothing but waiting to be smashed. And the last fight was totally unprofessional at all. The bad guys fight John with fair competition spirit as professional assassins. I mean, seriously?I do still have expectation to chapter 4. I hope they can make it back on track.",

        "text": "This film has several parts worth detailing. In the first we can see John Wick face his fate. At the end of the previous film, we could see that the profession of sicarios in the USA is the most demanded. Hundreds or thousands of them are present hiding in slightly more acceptable jobs. Finally, he gets a pass to Morocco, where we find that the sicarios present are the worst on the planet. In turn, in a surprising turn, the person responsible for that hotel is not even from the country (which did happen in previous movies). Hale Berry has such an unsy charming character that you really wish him death from the first frame. It seems that everyone who can offer solutions or guidance to John Wick has a mental problem, because they are unable to predict the short term and on top of that flaunt decisions that obviously do not make them fit for the elevated position they have. In the final part of the film, we can see Mark Dacascos proving that he's as good at cooking as he is with the sword. He is certainly a nod to his work on an important reality show. Then things obviously happen without any logical sense, but that serve us to contemplate a magnificent production design and scenery. We can see several clichés: when you can kill the protagonist, you prefer not to. You finally end up paying dearly. The twist is good, it looks like Ian McShane is the only chess player in the underworld. It's worse than the previous ones, but it still stays entertained.",

I LOVE the John Wick franchise, but every movie is kind of getting \"worst\" than the last one (which is ok, when your standars are that high).I still love the movie, is great, the action scenes are bigger, and with more elements than ever before in the franchise. However, the story losts itself a bit in the way. There isn't much more for John to do. Like, we learned in the first movie that he was retired, and didn't want anything to do with the criminal world anymore, so... what's the only way to get him back on action? To piss him off, and it works perfectly in the first one, and enough on the second one, but in Chapter 3, you kind of get confuse by what is really John Wick's motivation, if there is one really.So, you can see this two ways: You can't either complain and this will make you overlook the GIGANTIC action acomplishment that the movie is (the horse scene, the motocycles scene, the finale, and so on) or you can just let it all go, and enjoy the fun and entertaining stuff that Keanu and everyone behind the John Wick franchise are doing. I will, choose, the second option.I don't think any other John Wick movie will ever be as good as the first one, but it's fine, they don't need to.I can't ignore the finale tho, I hate when movies let that lose plot line hoping for a sequel, I was OK with in the second one, but it's because it made more sense there, two times in a roll is a bit much.7,5/10",

The first movie was good, as a basic revenge flick. We kind of got hints of the special 'world' Wick was a part of, but that wasn't really expounded upon until John Wick 2. In that one, we learn more about the rules and codes, and all the assassins hiding in plain sight lol. And so John Wick breaks a rule, and the third one continues where the second one ends, where he's on the run with a contract on his head.\nNow, this movie could have just gone a predictable route of him just killing every assassin until nobody was left. But that would be dull. So it shows him trying to figure out a way to cancel out the hit. It sort of does work, it might be the weakest part of the story. But we get to see so many great innovative fight scenes, that it's not a big deal.\nIt was great seeing the Indonesian martial artists from the Raid, although I found Mark Dacoscas character a bit underwhelming. His constant attempts at being a fanboy just served to diminish the bad-assness of his character.\nI was impressed by Halle Berry's fighting. That battle in Casablanca did go on a tad too long, but we got to see some interesting fight moments. And Halle's character was able to show off her potential. I hope she appears in the follow-up.\nNow the dumbest and I mean DUMBEST part of the movie was towards the end. John Wick falling off the roof of the continental. Bounces around, hitting everything he sees, and is still alive lol. Barely a scratch, except the wounds from the fight scene. Is this guy made of adamantium?!!! That could have been done a WHOLE lot better.\nOther than that misfire towards the end, this was an overall great improvement and continuation of the first two John Wick films. Go Keanu!",

        "text": "John Wick Chapter 3 is a success. It succeeds in doing what it should do and being self-aware enough to stick to what it knows it does. It's the type of movie that sticks to its lane, not trying to be overly ambitious, dramatic and it's definitely not trying to win the Oscar for best picture. The John Wick films are simple. This one, although a bit more complicated in certain aspects (which we'll talk about in a bit here) than the former entries in the series, continues to be a very simple premise that serves one purpose: To set up John Wick as a God Tier assassin who has to kill endless waves of other trained assassins in brutally satisfying ways. Since there is a ton of action in Chapter 3, the creators had to find a way to keep things fresh, which they most certainly did. Ranging from guns, assault rifles, shotguns, knives, swords, horses, motorcycles and dogs, the film manages to keep things pretty fresh as the creative ways Keanu Reeves kills all of these people. The action is mostly shot in wides, which is actually great because you get to really appreciate the choreography that goes into these films, especially in the scenes that are more martial arts/knife driven than the ones that are more about the guns. I will say that I personally enjoy these scenes a bit more, since for some reason I have always felt the stakes to be higher when it comes to being cut by a knife than getting shot. My favorite sequence in the entire movie is actually at the beginning where John Wick is fighting some asian dudes in this place that has like tons of knives in it, I think it's like a warfare museum or something. There's this really cool scene almost in the opening where John Wick grabs an old revolver but the bullets won't fit inside the barrel of the gun, so he disassembles the weapon and by using different parts of other weapons, he actually makes a new gun that can use the bullets in a very short period of time. This is what the John Wick movies are all about: Finding different, creative ways to kill people.As for negatives, I think that this film really lacks that deep emotional connection and desire for revenge that the first movie had. as well as its simplicity. In this one, it's just JW killing a bunch of people (which is totally fine and awesome), but it's lacking an emotional connection to why he's actually doing these things. I mentioned before that the film does get a bit more complex in certain ways and that is because the high table concept and the way that this assassin organization works gets explored in more detail. This is something that I totally get and can get behind of in concept, as I loved how in Chapter 2 this universe is more fleshed-out and expanded, which is great. In this one we follow an adjudicator for a substantial part of the film and it didn't really work for me as well as the details explored in the last film. Here, for me it just took away from the pacing, which wasn't so great.I almost forgot to mention the whole Halle Berry thing. I thought she did a great job and you can really tell she took the time and effort to learn the choreographies and do her own stunts, which I really enjoyed. I kinda laughed out loud during the part where John Wick is walking through the desert in his black suit waiting to get picked up by the \"grand master\" guy. I thought it was really funny considering just how simple the first John Wick movie was, just a guy getting revenge, a good old revenge flick. And this is like deep John Wick lore straight out of a comic book it would seem. I thought it was funny and interesting, definitely expanding on the John Wick universe, even if it detracts a bit from the \"main mission\".Overall, John Wick 3 is what it should be and it does its job well. It's an entertaining action movie where John Wick kills 300 people in horrible, creative ways. I really liked it.",

On the plus side, this plot is easy to understand.The fight scenes are not that good. John Wick is slow, and the unimportant fighters usually fight in stupid ways, like not taking cover in a gun fight, not ambushing, or not ganging up on John Wick. And of course most of their shots miss him.Don't know why they threw in Halle Berry. Her character could be played by an unknown actress and nothing would be lost. Actually I think an actress trained in martial arts or dancing would be even more fitting.Keanu Reeves' acting skill seems to have deteriorated. At times he seems to be reading the script out loud.If you enjoy a lot of hand combat, this is an ok movie. If you want to see a story, watch something else.",

        "text": "John Wick Chapter 3 is obviously the newest John Wick film. The first john Wick was a greatly fun action film; easily one of the best of the decade. Chapter 2 was even better. However, many times with franchises like this, with two great installments, the third film has a tendency to drop the ball. Does Chapter 3 do this? For the most part no.John Wick Chapter 3 is a marvel from an action standpoint. If you're an action junkie you'll definitely have your fill with this film. It takes place right where the previous film left off. From the very first minute, the action and tension are put on full blast and it almost never lets up. This film has the most action out of all three movies, and the most exhilarating action scenes at that, and that is saying something with this franchise. One action scene involving Keanu Reeves, Haley Barry, and even a couple of dogs, is my favorite of the movie. Though, there was so much action it bordered on action overload. By the end I was just exhausted like John Wick was by all the constant fighting with little story to back it.The film looks gorgeous as well. The locations and cinematography are amazing. I love this unique comic book esc world they've created. With each film they make the world look all the more extravagant and interesting, leaving me wanting to know more. All of the actors do a great job, particularly Keanu Reeves and Haley Barry. Though, Haley Barry isn't in the film as much as I would have thought. The score isn't particularly memorable, but it does its job.If there's a weak point in this film it's the plot. I know story has never been the focal point of the movies, but this one I'd say definitely has the weakest story. There's not really much story progression when compared to the others. At the end of this film he's in the same position as he was at the end of Chapter 2. At the end of that film he's a wanted man by the organization. Throughout the entirety of this movie he's on the run trying to get his bounty removed, but fails. At the end he's still a wanted man, setting up a sequel.This film very much feels like a transitionary film in to the next one. That's not necessarily bad. Empire Strikes Back and The Two Towers were transitionary films and they're fantastic. But it felt like more things happened story wise. They did expand upon The Table, which is at the top of the assassin organization that controls everything. We also get more hints at John Wick's past. But not much else.There also wasn't a clear cut villain and this one, like the other two, which was a bit weird. The main antagonist doesn't even show up until just before the third act. He's not really a villain, but more a final boss for John Wick to beat-up.Overall, John Wick Chapter 3 is an amazing action flick up there with the other two films. If you're just looking for a good time with great action and set pieces then this is your movie. If you want a good story then you might be a bit disappointed. It's a solid film overall, but I do think it's the weakest in the franchise so far.",

The guy is a scary giant sized killer, he appears to tower over Wick. Anyway, I really liked the way they used the theme of a \"book as weapon\" to enable John wick to win the fight. LIke \"the Matrix\" has so many of, this is a scene choreographed more as a dance than of killing & violence. Some will disagree,I am opposed to gun violence like this but I give it an 8/10 for what it is and to show how well this film is made. I don't recommend it for viewers under 18. But for adults, I recommend it, it was a blast. What were your thoughts? Do leave me a comment.",

Ancient Egypt concept would have been appropriate if Continental was a Jewish organisation.\n(2) It is nice to see that Continental is open for former European colonies and have no religious concerns but as I said before, due to the organisation's heavy emphasis on Christianity, a non-Muslim country such as India would have been much more appropriate than Morocco.\n(3) Even though Parabellum is a Hollywood product, John Wick trilogy has no problem with having a protagonist with Slavic origin and a Russian \"not-so-bad\" antagonist. So, Continental would have been spreaded over Balkans as well. It would brillantly suit to Continental's cosmopolitanist nature.",

I'd have preferred a more realistic, yet sentimental, angle. Similar to JW 1) and the end felt rather vapid. I would have much preferred if it were all part of the a bigger move vs. high table. This all feels like a setup for lots of sequels and ultimately, less quality content and more flashing lights...\"just add water\" sort of story-line.

In the second a greedy brother makes him (due to a blood oath) kill his sister (who John respects) so he can claim her seat.So what have the villains in John Wick: Chapter 3 done for us to root for John to finish them off? Well, the main antagonist is a douchebag who constantly taunts him and lets him live on multiple occasions where he has him clearly defeated (which is something his henchmen also do), which, more than anything, confused the hell out of me. I mean, isn't the guy supposed to be a professional hitman? So what the hell is he doing? Doesn't he want the 15 million $ reward? Also, why does Winston betray John? In the end of the second film, he breaks the rules of the High Table, losing his place as manager of the continental, by giving John time before his bounty is activated, so that he doesn't get immediately assassinated upon leaving the continental, saving his life. So why the hell would he try to kill John to get his position back? Honestly the only reason I gave it a 2/10 is because of some funny dialogue here and there with some references to classic action films, but other than that the movie is complete garbage. \"It's an action flick, story doesn't matter\" is not a defense for a poorly written film with arguably the worst plot out of any action film ever. Just because a movie is action oriented doesn't mean the story doesn't have to make sense and the actions of characters are allowed to be downright non-sensical.",

        "text": "This is the third John Wick movie of the trilogy and it was the most entertaining of all. We still had Keanu Reeves being John Wick, Ian McShane as Winston, Laurence Fishburne as the Bowery King, Lance Reddick as Charon, the hotel receptionist (maybe?)... In this third installment of the adrenaline-fueled action franchise, super-assassin John Wick (Reeves) returns with a $14 million price tag on his head and an army of bounty-hunting killers on his trail. After killing a member of the shadowy international assassin's guild, the High Table, John Wick is excommunicado, but the world's most ruthless hit men and women await his every turn everywhere.The performances are still good and it will always be like that. Keanu Reeves was betterand so were the others and there's a new character, Sofia played by Halle Berry, known for her roles from various action movies like Die Another Day, The Call, Kidnap and of course, she was the terrible Catwoman in one of the worst DC movies. However, she was excellent for her role. There's also Angelica Huston as the Director (not the director of a movie but in a play of the movie like there's a play scene and she was shown to be the director of it). There are two villains here (I think): the first one is Zero played by Mark Dacascos and the Adjudicator played by Asia Kate Dillon. The villains were also great but Zero's character was a bit weak.The action sequences were the best part of the movie. We could see more fightings in the third movie than the 2 previous ones (the first one was a bit too dramatic and the second one had boring conversations (but still I gave Chapter 2 a 9/10)). The best scene was when John Wick fought with a 2 meters tall guy with a book. It was totally crazy. It lasted a bit long and we could see that tall guy was really powerful but we knew that John Wick could defeat him and he did (as he said in Chapter 2 \"Whoever comes, I will kill them all!\"). I liked other action scenes as well. There were more enemies with their rifles looking for John Wick and when it came to EPIC, John Wick had a knife-throwing challenge with his enemies and he won. I was really impressed.However there is one unnecessary scene, the desert scene. It was extremely boring hearing John Wick talking to a person called the Elder and then Wick took a knife and cut off one of his fingers with a ring on. Then he had his hands burnt. I don't like that scene at all. It stopped me from being entertained.The ending was also unexpected. Here's the spoilers: The Adjudicator said \"What should we do with John Wick?\" and then Winston shot him as he said \"Oh he must die!\" and John Wick fell from the building. I was totally shocked but fortunately, he didn't die as a person carried him to the Bowery King who most audiences thought he was dead and then I figured out something that would 100% come true that there will be a Chapter 4 as this isn't the end.This wasn't really the best of the trilogy but definitely the most entertaining movie of the 3 (with pure action) and great conversations. In fact, Chapter 3 is truly unforgettable in most scenes.",

        "text": "*** WARNING, THIS MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS! ***The John Wick series is a bit of a guilty pleasure; when you want a slightly \"grudgy\" revenge film with lots of violence, then this is one of those alternatives to drama-heavy films.Chapter three however seems to be running out of steam, even though there is Nothing really wrong with it per se - it is by all means a very well produced product, appears almost flawless in it's execution, and delivers the goods properly. However, now in it's third outing, it seems to be somewhat lacking the frenetic/frantic nature of the first one, and a good portion of the sequel.However the film does have it's fair share of great moments worthy of watching, if violence and such is of course your forte. The first one-on-one fight in the library ends in a shocking way (at least for me), and parts of stable sequence have great momentum. The John Wick versus two \"ninjas\" in a weapons depot is also quite memorable and also ends in a way which may be too graphic for some viewers.I also give praise to have actor Mark Dacascos in the cast: now here's an actor we really don't see nearly enough of, even if he hams it up pretty thick in this film (probably not by his own volition, but a script requirement).Of course I could not write my opinion on this film without mentionning the guard dogs in the middle section alongside Halle Berry's character. It is fascinating to witness these dogs in action, and equally so thinking about the actors and stunt people who were met with the brunt/blunt force of these dogs. Easily one of the film's high points, and even though I am not a dog person at all, I can appreciate the effort put in this whole sequence / sub-chapter of the film's story.Performers are also quite equal to what we have come to expect of them from previous entries in the series. This isn't high art nor character studies and so most of the characters are there to move the story along, offer bumps along the way, and bring John Wick's character to the ending point... Which of course, like all \"good\" (...) Hollywood product again leaves the door open for possible sequels...There is nothing wrong with John Wick part 3. It is reminicent of the \"Fast And Furious\" franchise in the sense that these films are made for a target audience and are in effect produced in such a way to appeal to that audience as best it can, without taking too many chances to deviate from the established formulae as to not antagonize those who don't want deviation from the standard.However, as I mentioned earlier, at this point it seems to be becoming very repetitive and almost like an excuse to execute more stunts, gun work, and violence. Which is fine for those who enjoy this kind of movie, but in the end, it feels like we have already seen all this before in one shape or another in previously released films throughout the years.I gave it a 7 out of ten for the dogs and stunt people, for some quite frankly shocking moments in the violence/fight scènes, and of course for having Mark Dacascos and Angelica Houston in the cast.",

        "text": "The film is simply a succession of long, boring fight scenes with no story in between.John Wick is made ex-communicado after what happened in the second film. He fights his way out of the city to the Moroccan desert, calling in a couple of favours on the way, to try and have the bounty placed on his head removed. Then he goes back to New York to carry out his penance (or not).If you wonder how this weak plot can take over 2 hours, it is because John Wick has to fight waves of (supposedly) the world best assassins every 5 minutes. And yes after the 4th fight, it's already boring.\nEven the fight scenes are ridiculous. Humans barely flinching at getting knife after knife embedded in their bodies, head smashed into glass cabinets or being punched in the privates. Actors carrying out the obvious choreography with little emotion like they are thinking of the next move and setting it up slowly. And bad CGI.If you like your films to have a half decent story with some depth and tension, you won't like this film.",

They are well choreagraphed en perfectly made especially in the first act. 10/10 for that.Now let me explain my overall score. The first half of the movie (+\\- 1:20h in) deserves a 9/10. John has some nice moves with very brutal finishes and with interesting aditions to the John Wick Universe. The dogs have cool scenes and are great.The second part, by which I mean the third act of the movie however (3/10), is wayyy too repetitive. The killing just doesn't stop?! No further development of the plot and never ending fights that get boring. U start shaking your head by the things John survive. I get that he's the hero but falling of a 7 story building, hitting 2-3 iron bars and falling flat on the street ... It sets up a 4th installement but hopefully they develop a better plot for this one.Taking the mean of my 3/10 and 9/10 gives a 6.5/10 but I feel this movie only deserves a 6.",

The second part had its drawbacks, such as a boring mission to kill the customer's sister and the customer himself, to be honest, not a very interesting character, but the elaboration of the world was at its best. Here this side of the film was improved and John Wick ... not boring to watch. The plot itself was something in the spirit of a meat chop, but thanks to the writers for reminding the audience that they are there and adding a bunch of details, including how John just makes a bunch of deals with other people in order to somehow solve all the problems in a hurry. This is definitely a plus. Besides, they guessed what I wanted from the third act. From the action, they were able to come up with almost everything that is required from the genre. Great humor and proper application of Keanu Reeves with Ian McShane. I am very pleased with the viewing.\"",

In this franchise they did whatever they can do best and did it consistently. Actions with guns were very good with previous movies but in this movie director Chad stahelski diversified the actions with guns. Moreover he added scenes with knife actions and horseman vs motorcycle man. In the first act there was very quality in the fight secenes John kills a man with a book. Then there was a scene in Confidental hotel lots of mercenaries is sent by high table against John and it was very intense action scene . when you see that kind of action with gunfu you just want more and more. Keanu was also great in this movie. Side characters were good but not so speical. Halle berry, Ian Mcshane, Mark dacasscos and guys from The Raid movies was also good. My problem with the movie John doesn't solve his problem in the end and he finishes the movie where he begins. winston shots him in the roor of Confidental hotel and he doesn't kill him for some reason and he falls on the ground and Bowery King's mens finds him. Ending teases 4th movie. Briefly, it is very quality action movie you get what you expect from an action movie. I think it is the best movie of 2019 so far.",

I usually love Halle Berry but she was just okay at best, however her dogs stole the show and give us action scenes never before seen in the movies. I'm not squeamish and I don't mind cinematic violence but this may be the most violent film I've ever seen, yes, more violent than Quentin's films because he makes it so over the top that it lacks believability and is almost comical. There are some funny scenes in this but mostly an awesome plot and more brutal killing than I can recall in any other film. I really am surprised they got away with an R rating. You have to suspend reality as what John does is not possible, especially when he got his butt kicked, dog killed and car stolen in the beginning of episode one by a few nobodies before he became Batman. The repetition with the horses was a bit much and besides being ridiculous, almost ruined what could have been a unique and clever bit. The sound was incredible, especially the shotguns (if you can call them that) towards the end. If you like action, mega violence in the movies and have a sense of humor, go see this work of art. Hollywood hypocrisy at its finest. Thanks to John Wick: Chapter 3, you don't ever have to tolerate anyone in Hollywood lecturing you about gun violence.

        "text": "Frankly, I really love the first movie. A character like John Wick is so mysterious which was only appeared once in decades. Then come the second part which I was excited n waited for and even tho it ain't as mysterious as the first installment it showed how he was when before he met his wife, the assassin world n the high table which is great for me it was a development to the world of John Wick back when he was baba yaga. But in the third installment, it was a definitely an insult to his character, John Wick is like the God of assassin, he never cared what everyone think or said wether he's back or not or why he's back, merely only bcoz of a puppy! He didn't care n he just did everything on how he saw fit, that's his character that showed how mysterious he was, and he begged & cutted his own finger just to stay alive? That's the part that ruined the character which had been perfectly built. And for the story in parabellum for me it's exciting, the high table is just introduced and now it's war between both side. Well all I can say bout this third installment is I enjoy the action and the development with the high table. Hope to see more of his mysterious side on upcoming sequels.",

        "text": "What I liked about the first part was its simplicity and to an extent the grit of the main character in light of his grief. The story of a lonely guy moving on from its past and brought back due to injustice into the bad world again, is a story told many times across the times from westerns, martial arts and mafia flicks, and I have to say it has its appeal. However in effort to continue the franchise it has pushed the story to the edge of being irrational, and unnecessarily from a normal to a parallel world, where half the world is filled with assassins and entirely controlled by an organization. In attempt to create a parallel world the story is the first casualty and becomes incoherent, making it painfully shallow. Quite similar to Matrix, where the brilliant first part becomes unnecessary and incoherent in the subsequent parts in an attempt to create a franchise. The action sequences especially the hand to hand fights are choreographed very well and takes it as far as it can (pleasant to see some of the indonesian fighters from Raid), the gunfights appear to be completely unrealistic and bordering video game territory where John wick kills hundreds without getting a single shot. By the end of it as you realize that it stretches for another part and may not be concluded any time soon as long as it makes money, like john wick you are left angry too.",

        "text": "What a lot of the people writing these reviews saying \"it's nothing but non-stop action without a story\" fail to realize is that the whole premise of this movie being non-stop action was set up right from the last movie. These movies are definitely meant to be watched as a single long movie, otherwise it can feel pretty jarring going into this movie after not having seen the last one for a few years. The experience is much more rewarding watching this trilogy back-to-back, as each installment shows John facing the consequences of his actions in the last one. The scene of John making his way through the park at the end of 2 watching everyone turn to face him when the open contract on his head is sent out sets this movie up to be what it is, and if you went into this one thinking that it was going to be one half set-up/story and one half action then you must have completely missed the last 20 minutes in the last movie. That's what the first 2 movies were for, to set up this one, as him being on the run trying to atone for his actions while also trying to keep himself from being killed. I removed two stars only for the fact that, yes, the action scenes can feel a little long towards the second half of the movie, and I had to watch this movie in two separate sittings as it can feel a little draining to watch, but that doesn't mean the long action scenes are \"pointless\" or \"without plot\" or \"dull\" because that's not true, the action scenes are very well choreographed and the attention to detail is well-done. So do yourself a favor before watching this, and watch all three films back-to-back as they all take place one right after the other, otherwise this movie will just seem like mindless action with no set-up.",

That is the whole story and it is idiotic. Fight scene after fight scene is not enough for a good action movie, you need the main character to have some motivation for their actions other than to \"I want to live to remember my dead wife\".\nBest acting in the whole thing was the dogs. It is left wide open for a sequel as well, let's milk this franchise for everything we can. Does no one in Hollywood have a shred of dignity or integrity left? First film was fine, and they should've stopped there. I have given this 10 stars for whoever trained the dogs, but I had to subtract 7 for the dialogue, repetitive mindless fight scenes and complete lack of a single coherent reason for any of Mr Wick's actions. I would like to have written a better review, but this film has actually lowered my IQ.",

But it is possible to make such a movie good - The Raid gets into mind. Even with little character building you can get engaged because it feels like a genuine fight for life. Here, no matter how much gore is presented it feels like a walk in a park. You are absolutelly sure nothing bad is going to happen. JW3 even had a guest from said film (the raid) - a true martial artist Mad Dog, which performed some stellar fights, but not in this film. He died a same pathetic death as countless other faceless figures. Now you are certain nothing is chanhing, all will be fine, no matter how many or how much armed enemies are coming. It all is just annoying noise. Remember the stale chuck norris jokes? Well the whole movie is basically that. Multiple buses of killers with swat gear? No problem, john will take them out with his belt.\nI get that this universe has its own rules, all the \"know it all, eye in the sky\" that is \"the Table\" junk. but john walking off multiple gunshots and a fall from the skyscraper roof? That was a final insult. So yeah spoiler alert - its another superhero movie. What will we uncover in the next installment? Who knows, maybe in his childhood he was bit by a radioactive dog? Ridiculous. Giving three stars for nice interiors though.",

The long, dragged out action scenes where the same repeated actions, shooting and moves happens over and over and over again is dull to say the least. It ends up feeling like filler, artificially extending the playtime of the movie beyond what's needed for this kind of movie.The first movie in particular had at least some characters, development and story. It was by no means rich of story, but it had the basics. The 2nd one was lighter on story, and now the 3rd has almost abandoned it all. Just one dull action scene after another. The scenes would be more fun with more creative kills, gore and overall just shorter scenes so it's not repeated so much.SPOILERS:\nThe whole plotline of him going to see the \"elder\", which was just some young dude hanging out in the desert of Morocco, only for him to return to NYC to drop the pledge he worked so hard to even get... just seemed pointless. When the credits started rolling with an obvious hint to the next movie, I rolled my eyes and almost thought it was a joke. I had hoped they could wrap up the story in this one. It really seems like they are only milking the cash cow with this one, since they seem to have run out of ideas of where to take this franchise and story.",

Some questions of the second part were answered, some loose ends were tied up. The people who claim that this movie is 80-90 % action are exaggerating. I thought it was about fifty percent action and 50 % story. The story was good, the locations were beautiful. Some new characters were introduced. I especially liked the Adjudicator. The character Mark Dacascos was playing seemed a bit creepy in the trailers but turned out to be intriguing. The movie was not as brutal as chapter 2 but that didn't bother me. The ending promises a fourth part which I'm going to watch.Overall, I liked it even better than the first part and will watch it again.",

        "text": "As others have said it's like watching someone play a first person shooter video game where someone has the invincibility cheat activated, It's like going to a video game arcade and watching a couple of teenagers play Time Crisis co-op with the infinite ammo cheat on. Everything just happens too fast on screen for you to really enjoy it and take anything in... It's 98% action, 1% character development and 1% plot.My biggest complaint about JW3 is the best action scenes are right at the start of the movie instead of the end.... The scene where Wick is fighting the huge guy and breaks his jaw and neck with a book and then the knife fight scene that follows almost directly afterwards are the two best scenes of the whole movie. After this the rest of the action scenes are just shallow, boring and drag on for far too long. Especially the overblown fight scene at the end where Wick is repeatedly getting kicked through panes of glass but keeps getting up time and time again only to be kicked through another one and then another one and then another one and then another one.....It's one of those movies that makes you question your own intelligence for having watched it. The acting is terrible from everybody, especially Asia Kate Dillon who literally acts out her role as if she's a robot. Halle Berry is terrible, no one else we care about due to the severe lack of character development.Keanu is way past his use by date for playing these kinds of action roles, the dudes nearly 60. He needs roles that are more suited to his age bracket. Yes I know he worked extremely hard physically for these JW movies but it's overshadowed by such poor direction and writing.It really is sad to see what Hollywood has done to the action genre since the 80's and 90's.",

I enjoyed all of the films a lot, but 3 started to drag on a bit too much and became very repetitive. I was hoping this would be the last John Wick movie, and it felt like it should have been, but unfortunately at the end there's just more sequel-baiting and a far more ridiculous cliffhanger than the one in the 2nd film (which has a brilliant cliffhanger, imo, and really set up that the 3rd film could mean the end of John Wick). The 2nd one overall just has my favourite scenes, and these films are more about the amazing action sequences and visuals, rather than any engrossing story, making it all the more annoying that they've just stretched out the story for another sequel.Also, John's motives in this film felt poorly written this time around. He wants to live on so that he can remember his dead wife? I get that he's still grieving but it comes across as lame and unnatural motivation. It doesn't matter if he's alive to remember her, because he'll die eventually anyway, and just going about the rest of his life moping around about his dead wife is pointless. The acting was also at its worst in this film.Come for the great action and visuals, but spend every other scene cringing at everything else and leave the cinema feeling a bit \"meh\" about the whole experience.",

Only slight down side is that this feels more like a middle movie, and I feel as though by now we should have had at least one or two more \"new buddies\" team with John at the end - even though that is the theme that he's alone and he can do all the ass kicking on his own. Perhaps we can save it for the next one.I will not downplay Charons character though. In my viewing the audience cheered him on, and bursted out laughing when John complained to him about needing more fire power, and his reply was \"Armor piercing\". And yes I understand it's a John Wick movie titled John Wick but Sofia could have come back on her own at the end if not a new \"old friend\" who maybe is not so old. The franchise has enough attention grabbing qualities that we for sure will get another movie. So count me in for the next one with popcorn and applause.",

First there was the part where John Wick made his own gun, shot a guy, suddenly got into a fight with knives and hit and shot, with like 15 knives, at one guy, then started killing the others with horses. I mean. WOW, HOW do you come up with that.The movie has you sitting on the edge of your seat throughout the film. Can't criticise this, just can't",

It isn't as awesome as the previous parts. It's the same theme song on repeat. No new additions.John Wick is one of my favorite movies ever, and I am sad to see it not in the same level as the previous 2 parts. However, it's a must see movie, as the action and acting is just great. Never miss seeing this!",

I really hated the movie and the whole series in those scenes, and I wanted to stop watching and put 1-2 stars, but I decided to continue because I love the series, and I hoped that this absurdity will end and Sofia will not appear again, and this is what happened, So thats why I put 7 stars at the end.",

        "text": "The first movie was a fresh start on the kliché hitman trying to stay out-franchise. The fighting techniques were as real as they were choreographed and Keanu has been training hard with competent instructors.The the second movie were as sequels usually are - more of everything, but still managed to retain somewhat of a engaging storyline and refine further on the concept.Parabellum, however, is a step back. John Wick has gotten plain stupid. He clears area after area of assassins armed to the teeth, but leaves unarmed himself. In one episode the fight takes place in an arms museum of some sort, but Mr. Wick still leaves unarmed. He is also obviously slow in hand to hand combat. Probably signs of both age and the apparent disadvantage of always fighting in a suit.The adversaries are very considerate however, and the only reason John Wick survives. Not only do they time and again obviously wait for Mr. Wick to strike first or get away, they try to wrestle him from behind instead of stabbing him with held knifes or using holstered pistols, they also refrain from chances of fulfilling their given mission to kill him, to instead offer a hand so Mr Wick can get up.The motorcycle scene is especially stupid. Trained assassins with swords that only attacks the head and upper torso, that can actually avoid the attacks, instead of targeting the lower body that has nowhere to go. Oh, they also have guns, but they don't just shoot him. Honorable assassins don't do that, I suppose.It is so stupid and unbelievable that it takes me out of the movie experience. I can accept unrealism in a movie, after all it is a movie. But I can't accept \"professionals\" acting incompetently or irrationally in their professional functions.",

        "text": "While the first two John Wick movies are really good, John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum has action that is incredible satisfying to the max. I watched this movie back in August of this year and I was mind blown at what I saw. I had a feeling that it would improve and I was correct. It is definitely my favorite one in the series. I loved this movie so much that I bought the Blu-Ray of it the day after it came out.This film is where John Wick is now the target of the world's most ruthless killers after he guns down a member of the High Table, which is an international assassin's guild. He is now fighting is way through the streets of New York as well as being stuck with a $14 million bounty.This movie had a amazing plot. I liked it a lot more than the first 2 movies plots.The acting was great. Keanu was at his best in this film, and I would say he was better in this film than he was in the first two. He had a lot of energy and personality in the last two movies, but here, he goes above and beyond and is a total bad.The other actors did great as well. Halle Berry did great as Wick's sidekick, Sofia. Her and Reeves had good chemistry.Like I said, the action was intense and spectacular. At times, the movie has a Kill Bill vibe to it because of the swords the characters get to use to battle each other.SPOILERS BELOW THIS POINT!!! The one thing that shocked me the most was the ending. The ending is basically a cliffhanger. John Wick gets betrayed by Winston (played by Ian McShane) and gets brutally killed. He then wakes up with Bowery King (played by Laurence Fishburne) who got betrayed earlier in the movie. The movie ends with what seems like these two are going to team up for a John Wick 4.At first, I thought this was going to be just going to end the John Wick series, but I was wrong. They will most likely end the series with the next one as Wick and King will team up to take down the High Table. I'm really excited for John Wick 4 which should be coming out in the summer of 2021.All in all, I highly recommend John Wick 3. It was great and for over 2 hours, it is worth your time to go check this movie out.This is definitely my 2nd favorite movie of 2019 (1st being \"Avengers: Endgame\") and it is one of the best action movies of the 2010's.",

Some people say Keanu's acting is bad, but watch Devil's Advocate. He can act.In this movie, Keanu doesn't say much. That leaves us with Keanu Reeves famously-wooden face to act. And the movie at one point shows some self-awareness when a bad guy says, \"I think Wick's getting slow.\"At 55 years old, Keanu (pretty sure he did the fight scenes, maybe it was a double) didn't really pack the explosiveness you'd expect in the \"boogeyman,\" the guy who killed a few hundred men in one sitting. Still enjoyable, but you're watching a 55 year old man fight off dozens trained fighters.However, some of the acting...I cringed. Especially from the adjudicator (played by Asia Kate Dillon). When she says, \"Kneel! ...and pledge your fealty!\" it sounds like a scene from Stepbrothers where the two brothers are fantasy role-playing and putting overdrama in their voices; or like a middle school drama class rehearsal.Who decided to put 95 lbs girl who looks and sounds like she could be 15 years old into the role of the \"big boss\" of all the big bosses (Winston, 76 years old, had been in charge of the Continental and a beacon of order and stability for over 40 years).Yet here is this age 20 or 30 frail reed with a brittle voice (trying to force an ominous voice) command big bosses two or three times her age. It's almost less believable than the fight scenes. This is not the role for Asia.About one third of the population are assassins. The other two thirds are regular people, except that they continue walking to the coffee shop, unflinchingly, when 2 or 3 guys get knifed to death in broad daylight a few feet away.The fight scenes were over the top.\nSometimes to the point of absurdity.\nBut they were very creative.For example, Halle Berry just now shot some knifeman in the head...actually, I think that's supposed to be a miss. Rewound it and she missed because knifeman dodged the bullet (turned his head quickly).Then, after trying to shoot him in the head from six feet away (and missing), instead of shooting at knifeman again and probably hitting the target this time, SHE RUNS UP TOWARDS KNIFEMAN, jumps in the air, scissors her legs around his neck, twerks him down on the ground, then point blank shoots him in the head now that she's grappled him down.That is an inefficient way to take care of a bad guy-especially when there are swarms of bad guys spawning from behind every wall running toward you (in this case, waiting for you to kill the bad guy you're with...the bad guys in this movie are polite that way, bad guys usually wait their turn).I've never been in the military, but I'm pretty sure that when you have a gun with infinite ammo and you're fighting a knifeman, you DO NOT deliberately close the distance between you and knifeman.My fighting method would be the following 3 steps:1. Keep all knifemen beyond arms reach,\n2. Shoot knifemen before they get near you.\n3. Avoid charging towards a knifeman (especially when you have bullets).Another problem is that sometimes John Wick and Halle Berry are surrounded, but that's because they stand in the center of a clearing, with bad guys all around. Would be wise to get against a wall so all threats are from one direction (a bad guy can't jump you from behind if your back is to a wall).*Spoiler Alert*\nThe last word of the movie is, \"Yeah.\"Now you know the ending.For what it's worth, I liked the last half of the movie better than the first half.",

Ssseriously??😵When you GO WAY OVERBOARD GLAMORIZING SCENES OF FIGHTING, SHOOTING, AND KILLING, you can contribute to: immature and not too smart people believing it's way too easy and cool doing stupid things, people becoming addicted to video games that kill, as well as ongoing school shootings across the nation.It's also unfortunate because there are some great actors in this movie, if the creators would only give them more than a handful of lines.Also, here's a crazy@$$ idea. If ya ever have an international hit on your head worth MILLIONS of dollars, ya may want to consider AT least buying a WIG, if not the works 😯; otherwise, you can come off as...not too bright.John Wick is supposed to be a famous, unstoppable badass, but yet, has no common sense??Rotten 🍅s gave this movie a rating of 89%; they are COMPLETLEY UNRELIABLE now.Even though chapter 2 was overall unpleasant to watch as well, my husband and I wanted to give chapter 3 a shot since 1) we already rented it, 2) Halle Berry's in it, and 3) the first chapter was actially pretty good.However COMMA we're so done with this ridonkulous series.And hopefully, the good to great actors will RESPECT and LOVE themselves enough to realize that they deserve to be in MUCH BETTER QUALITY movies since they're worth more.Now perhaps many are on board with this soul-draining series because it's popular to the mass, and because they're about quantity over quality (part of poverty consciousness).But happened to having some pride in one's vast imagination and powerful, creative abilities?You may not want to waste your invaluable energy and time on this movie.

        "text": "As many others have pointed out, there are several excellent but drawn out fight sequences. The camerawork is solid and the overall aesthetic is quite good. I also liked the choice of music throughout the movie.However, it's a fun party movie where you don't have to actually pay attention to anything. Just like many of the fun action movies from the 80s and 90s with Dolph Lundgren, Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and whoever else became \"expendable\" (read: The Expendables (2010)) later on.I my opinion, the movie didn't take itself serious and should be enjoyed as such. A Popcorn Flick.\nAmmunition is either not available or unending, shots are either perfect or total misses, everyone except for the main cast is a faceless 'red shirt', only there to be killed off in a creative and sometimes hilarious fashion. Pain (and even death) is optional. Overstretched or broken(?) limps have next to no consequences. Armor makes no sense. People can vanish at will. There is no sense of real danger and nothing is at stake.\nAlso, the movie is missing a 'big bad'. The organization behind everything makes no sense and everyone must follow the rules, but the rules are arbitrary and can be changed at will and at any time. The other antagonist (Zero) is more like a fanboy and not a real enemy. The judge-chick makes no sense and is boring.Survival as the only goal of the protagonist doesn't make for a good plot, except maybe for a horror movie.\nI much rather preferred John Wick as the hunter and not the (unkillable) prey.On the other hand, it has great choreography, sword-, knife- and gunfights, murder doggos, a great cast and most of all Keanu Reeves, so 6/10.Still, if you have a few hours to spare, better watch the first movie twice.",

        "text": "I gotta say... This movie is brutal, so much more than its previous. The fighting scene is choreographed beautifully (and violently). The gunshot, hand to hand and any other weapon available scene is totally adrenaline induced (for me anyway). John Wick looks badass in every fighting scene (the dogs also got lots of biscuits from me, they are such a good dogs).We will get a glimpse of the motives behind some character, which is interesting but sadly not much explored (Anjelica Huston as the Director, Hale Berry as Sofia, etc). Apparently many of the assassins are John Wick's admirer/hardcore fans. I like how Yayan Ruhian and Cecep Arif Rahman characters' is being portrayed in this movie (bonus point since they did not just killed off in this movie, so maybe someday they will face off again?). They have some dialogue in Indonesian surprisingly, since I thought they will say it in English.I am intrigued about the high table and the structure that they have (how do you become the elder sitting around in the middle of desert but still looking fine? or adjudicator who listing assassins or other dangerous people about their misdeed and telling them that they only got 7 days to make settlement?). The assassin network and channel/parties intertwined are also need to be explored further (so far I see the hobos network, the operators place, doctor for assassin, ballet/assassin-will-be training mansion where John Wick came from, another Continental Hotel in different country, the place they make their own currency). Hopefully we will see more in next movie.It is a great action movie, and I am not disappointed so far. The ending make me anticipate how it will play up in next movie.PS: a dog is shot but don't worry, he/she is fine",

And I'm glad I watched it, because I've seen all the John Wick, and this one's my favorite. Long live Chad Stahelski.\nChad Stahelski is just having a great career, since I've been through all of John Wick, I should take my foot off the gas. John Wick: Parabellum is simply the action movie of the year, of 2019, it dethrone Avengers Endgame for my part, I mean I think it's much better, that's it.\nScenes.\nJohn Wick: Parabellum invades the screen with action scenes, we take action scenes in the face, John Wick Parabellum puts us in full view, with his gunfight and his sequence of choreography, with its violence including the scene of Knives remains entertaining and very tenacious, the scene of horses with the big blows of extreme hoof in the guy's mouth, his satisfying motorcycle race with great action, the scene of the library where John Wick a giant with a book etc.\nPERSONNAGES\nAfter for the characters, it's bof, because there are some that are useless for my taste, the Chinese who is played by Mark Dacascos, the guy is just a fan of John Wick and I find his appearances useless, I find it not interesting. There's also the cwoer, where I don't hang on, because every time she appears, it's boring, the scenes with her are slow etc. After for the characters I love there's Sofia, a big talent edin in terms of combat, with her malinois too cute. John Wick who still survives but he can not fight well (because he's getting old), but it's getting less and less interesting for me. Winston the old man I still can't hold on to, Charon that I find a little more interesting Ssant in this opus because he fights and he serves a lot towards the end, I was telling myself that he is doing pretty well, John Wick and Charon is a sick duo. In addition there is Vivaldi's music from the four seasons in the scene where John Wick allies with Charon (I know it has nothing to do because I have to talk about the characters).\nSo here's my opinion on the characters ^^\nNEGATIVE AND ILLOGICAL\nAnd lately what bothers me in this film is that the guy who holds the white pigeon in his hand, gets sliced everywhere and we see him posay in his seat at the end. And lately it's that John Wick falls from hyper high, he takes the barrier hyper strong in his back and he stays alive. That's what bothered me. And then I was so scared for John, because if he died I would cry.\nWell, I know my review is short, but I just wanted to show you my points that there are on this movie ^^\nI can't wait for John Wick's blu-ray and steelbook to come out ^^\nI ban the film at least 12 years with warning.",

        "text": "Most people who dislike this film say that it's 2 hours non-stop action/fight scenes and that by the end they get tired of it. I say there is not enough action, by that I mean original John Wick action, and too much droning on about the high table and the its secret society politics and bureaucracy B.S. and that's why by the end half the audience gets bored.Chad Stahelski kept saying in interviews that they \"expanded the story\". I say they didn't expand it, they just padded it with stupidity. Bureaucracy, politics, and gruesome rituals does not a story make. Tip: A little bit of mystery goes a long way.Talking about rituals, JW3 is taking a simple but brilliant action movie franchise too far down the conspiracy rabbit whole, taking the audience on a ride they did not ask for. Why was it necessary to brand John twice like a cow? And for him to accept and willingly subject himself to this treatment? Why was it necessary for him to self mutilate and cut his finger off? (Keanu's hand now having to be airbrushed in all subsequent movies.) Why does this alpha male unstoppable assassin all of a sudden emasculate and accept to be a servant to the secret society elites? In fact several times telling them that he WANTS to SERVE them. Happy to be a slave? WTF?Also there is so much christian symbology used throughout the film that it seems the writers are struggling with their faith and spirituality and are purging their religious existential crisis onto the viewers.I really hope that in JW4 John gets rid of the high table and all its nonsense in the first 15minutes and gets back to a semi-normal life, avenging new foes. What made the first JW story good was that John Wick was a HUNTER, not a prey or a servant, and he had a resemblance of a normal life, making him relatable to the audience.Now let's get to the action sequences. The library - great idea and well executed but was totally unrealistic due to the sheer size difference between the two of them. It felt like the villain LET John win, as he didn't do much to overpower him. I think a giant like Boban deserved to have a better, longer role written for him, somewhat like Jaws in James Bond.The horse sequence was much talked about in the press and interviews, and it was absolutely fantastic from beginning to end but much too short. More time should have been dedicated to it and less to the boring end-boss glass room fight, which just went on and on and on to justify the flashy and unrealistic set that they built. That set with its giant moving screen wall was way too matrix sequel-ly, and that's not a good thing.Ditto to the motorbike sequence, fantastic but much too short compared to the lesser, more boring fight scenes.The knife fight sequence was just right, but too gruesome. Loved the lead up scene to it where John had to prep and load ancient guns, I think this idea should have been explored further.The desert scenes were stunning, but the Casablanca sequence was embarrassingly Hollywood cliché, complete with belly dancers. Sheesh I thought for a second I was watching the SATC sequel. Keanu is a worldly guy, why did he ok this silly cliché-riddled drivel? The dog fight scenes were alright, but you get the feeling that whole Casablanca sequence was unnecessary. Here the story unraveled in an unpleasant way with Sofia having nothing but hatred for John (much like 'the Director'), despite the fact he helped her previously (alluding to a previous friendship) and some terrible dialogue about her urge to kill her own daughter. WTF?Finally, the semi-final battle at the Continental hotel which was true original John Wick style and amazing. Loved how they picked the guns, loaded them, did their thing (having to go for the neck) and then came back for the armour piercing guns and did the good work with those. It was cool that Charon actually got to do some action in this chapter (although not enough of it was shown!) and that he kept surviving and coming back to reload like John. Makes you question whether he is as good an assassin as John?Once again this sequel is missing the kick-ass soundtrack that the first JW had, despite numerous fans complaining about its absence in the first sequel. Still, the producers didn't listen and there are no cool songs in this film either.It pains me to give this film a 3 star rating, but I have to, due to the ridiculous unrealistic story, awful dialogue and the one dimensional characters with no depth to them.The 3 stars are purely for the brilliant action sequences and the actors' and director's work and dedication that went into them. The rest is terrible drivel, made all the more worse by the fact that it took 4 screenwriters to NOT come up with a good story.",

It didn't.But the worst thing of the movie was the obvious rippoff of the classic, Bruce Lee's, Enter the Dragon, with it's ground breaking scene in the house of mirrors. I felt cheated. Yes, it is John Wick, and yes, he kills a lot of people, but... but, if you do make a Chapter 4, for the love of God, get the same people who made 1 and 2.",

The first 25 minutes of this film were the best and it included a knife fight that was jaw dropping and some horse kicks that were flat out awesome. My only issues of this film were the incredibly unrealistic survivals of Bowery (Laurence Fishburne), and John Wick. Bowery was ordered to be cut 7 times for the 7 bullets he gifted to John Wick in Chapter 2 by the High Table. After recieving these cuts, Bowery appears to go limp and tumble over, but is shown alive and well at the end of the movie. As for John Wick, he takes a fall off of The Continental towards the end of the film and hits both a fire escape and the ground at about 100 mph...and LIVES. Just minor \"only in a movie\" events but it was just to much for me.\nChapter 4 will be made, and I am finding it hard to see how this series will come to an end if the characters can't die.\nStill surely worth the watch and the Blu-Ray purchase.",

        "text": "The world that John Wick is a part of has been developing for three movies already and it keeps getting better. The story is not the most complicated one, however, it does develop also and in my opinion is quite good.\nChapter 1: The first part of the movie was portraying John as a normal guy living in a normal world. Very little was known about the assassins and their own secret world. Towards the end of the movie we only knew a little more about Keanu's character - we knew he managed to get out, but it was not clear how. We knew he was skilled assassin but he was getting some beating too since he was \"Retired\". We knew that there are others like him but we did not know exactly what kind of life they were living.\nChapter 2: At the end of the first movie, John Wick said he was back and we could see that in the Chapter 2. The action went up, he became more effective and brutal and more parts John Wick's past were brought up. It's important to remember that all three movies basically take place in a very short time of each other in terms of the story line - the motivation of the character also developed from seeking only for revenge in Chapter 1, then looking to finish that revenge and trying to break free again in Chapter 2. In Chapter 3 he was even seeking refuge because he saw that he cannot win this fight.\nChapter 3: Apart from the first few action scenes, John Wick was trying to escape - he was looking for a way to end this since it was clear he cannot keep it up. The way they shaped the story that he got a safe passage back to NYC, throwing him back into the madness was actually quite clever. By doing so they managed to justify his travel - his motivation to leave NYC was to escape the bounty hunters who were after him, his motivation to go to Casablanca was to put an end to the contract on his head, going back to NYC was supposed to finalize that deal. His desire to see Winston as a friend was also understandable - he lost Marcus (Daniel Defoe's character), he lost his wife and he just came back from years of living a \"normal life\" so you could see he was more sentimental than his \"old self\".\nThe action scenes is the thing that defines the entire franchise, but there is still decent story line which can introduce other characters and can keep things interesting for quite a while. Definitely a fantastic action movie - just go and see it!",

Personally, and this just me, I see the comments about the unrealism and I must ask; do you want to just see some basic special ops predator fighting?\nHere's a guy who was part, got out, got disrespected, got back in, got betrayed, then got triple crossed, by this super secret ultra lethal assassin; do you think the way people are killed by him would be normal??\nThe fight scene with Halle Berry's character was one of the best and more realistic, because we all know she wouldn't have survived without the dogs.\nThe camera angles, lighting, outstanding. Music synchronization to the shots being fired.Believe me, going in the movie with an open mind will make the film a ton of a lot better. Oh and also, the movie honestly wouldn't have benefited from more dialogue, and that's not a bad thing, it just doesn't need any unnecessary talking.",

I was gasping, hiding my eyes and just shaking my head in the utter violence in the deaths in this film it was amazing. It's totally over the top, it's ridiculous but that's the point. You don't watch this film for reality AND we get some background about Mr Wick that's mind-blowing! This film is exactly what it says on the tin and I'm already pre ordered for the 16th Sept digital release so I can watch this at home in true HD. So many parts of this film were perfectly executed including the Halle Berry dog fight, the first book death and the amazing fight with Zero's two goons at the end which was epic fight gold. So many good actors and actresses in the film make this the best ever. This includes the dogs and the horses too! The Adjudicator is v. scary, Zero and his team unstoppable, Roll on John Wick 4!",

Every street, building, room John walks into contains at least 50 people working for the super secret underground organisation. John manages to kill hundreds as they seemingly wait in line for their turn to be killed by him. Including two bud loads of the tables apparent best.Then at the end he falls from the roof of a multi story building, bouncing off several things on the way down. And still survives. Not even knocked out.I'm all for suspending believe when watching a film and would have been happy to do so if this film had a plot or a story but it has neither.

Yes I am able to suspend belief for the sake of a good viewing experience. However, surely by now all the 'bad guys' (a blurred concept in the John Wick universe), must realise that to run at John Wick with a gun rather than selecting a secure vantage point to take a head shot is a bad idea. Surely they realise that after running him over repeatedly in cars, the best time to get him is before he gets up and runs away again. Surely the high table are less flippant than to swing their decisions based on a good fight?etc. etc. I'm okay with the concept that keeping a low profile on the back of a horse in New York city wouldn't be everybody's choice, but there are just too many situations like this that make it hard for me to completely immerse myself in the tidal wave of John Wick mania. And God knows I want to because it is all just so much fun to watch.",

The scenes were insane like the libary fight scene, the shootout in Arabia, the motorbike shootout, the stable fight scene. It all was amazing! I recommend to watch it to all people. It sometimes can get a bit brutal. It way more violent then the other two. But it's more action packed then the other two. It's a must watch movie they you should I watch. That why I give this movie a 10/10 and when I do give something 10/10 I mean it's REALLY GOOD. So watch this movie you won't regret it!",

The initial appeal of the John Wick franchise was due to a fresh idea, interesting storyline, great fight scenes and great editing and special effects.Unfortunately with this movie the fight scenes (although done well) have been dialled up to 11 whilst leaving all other important aspects of filmmaking dwindling as an afterthought. The storyline is an amazing concept but is overshadowed by stupidity long fight scenes and some less than ideal scriptwriting.The movie could have been 30 minutes shorter and still had been as entertaining. The fight scene with Halle Berry and her dogs was the highlight of the film, it was done so well. If only the amount of effort put into that 10 minutes of the film was carried over to the rest it would have been half decent.If you liked the first two movies you will of course have to sit through this one but just don't go into it with high expectations.",

The performances were all fine, and the rather simple plot also took a very interesting turn after a couple twists at the end.Overall, i'd say i still like the first John Wick more because i feel like Keanu gave his best performance in that movie and Viggo is still the best villain so far; but this was a lot better than Chapter 2 imo.I'm very excited for Chapter 4 now. Can't wait to see John take on Winston, who i think can surpass Viggo as best villain; and more of the action...man this franchise just NAILS the action all the time. So good.",

Last thing the villain was ok but for a 3 movie I felt it needed a super bad ass villain. Regardless it's still a good watch non stop action and great fighting scenes still I think a 7/10 recommended watch",

Moreover you can't predict what's going to happen like 99% of the movie.",

It has brutal fatalities and plenty of knife fight . I found the fight scenes different from the 2 others movie, it was refreshing and they were more detailed .The dog scene was awesome and Hally Berry did really good. We've got to know more characters and this bring more options for chapter 4 .I would of like a more epic final battle in the case john wick would of die but knowing that there will be a 4 th and knowing that he will be fighting alongside with lawrence , Hally and probably Winston against the high table for a huge epic finale is promising .What I liked most is that every kills or action scenes could actually happen in real life , theres no captain marvel and theres no hulk there only Skilled assasin's that trained all their life. they dont jump from towers to towers in Cars either ( fast and furious ) . Please note that I liked the fast and furious movies but you can clearly see that actors from the john wick movie actually worked hard to make these scenes credible.To me it is the new era of action movies and so far John wick is the one to beat .thanks",

        "text": "I had a good experience with this movie, as I did with all 3. However I do think it was the weakest of the so-far trilogy when it comes to story (though these movies aren't really meant to be watched for story). But, at least in the other movies I was intrigued by the plot, where in this one I just found myself waiting for the next fight scene to go down.It also struggles in that the best fight scenes happen in the beginning of the movie. The creative kill in the library against NBA's Boban Marjonovic, the stable fight using horses was non sensical but amazing, and my favorite, the glass cases filled with knives were great, I thought if the rest of the movie just does this it'll be the best one yet. However I think after that they start to falter.John fighting with Halle Barry's character had a lot of great gun fu, but I realized there that im really only interested in seeing Keanu Reeves take down the red shirts. Every time it went to Halle Barry (although she executed her scenes beautifully) I just wanted it to go back to our protagonist's famous headshots and takedowns. The fights also suffer where the other 2 movies didn't as much when John fights 2 opponents at a time, he hits one and he's stunned for a minute rolling in the background as the other attacks him, then stuns that one and the other guy gets back up to attack again.Also, the scenes where assassins that work together in stealth to slice up guys for the high table woman were so cool, but when it came time for Wick to fight them it was a bit underwhelming. It felt our protagonist was making mistakes during the fight for the sake of the plot and didn't flow as well as it should've, where instead of showing him start to get tired and faltering, he really should've been going all out against these other fantastic physical actors in the final fights against the 2 groups of shinobis for the climax of fight scenes.I was also not expecting to laugh as much as I did, the humor was subtle and didn't suffer from the marvel humor that action movies keep recycling that goes on for too long.I'll probably like this movie more when I see it a second time. The story is missing the simplicity of the first, and missing Common from the second (was really expecting to see him come back in this one). I'm still super excited for the 4th and hope they keep pumping out these out until immortal Keanu is finally returns to wherever he came from.",

Fighting scenes and dialogues are the major set back of this third chapter; very very unnatural fight choreography especially from Keanu. He is presented much more vulnerable physically, contradicting the concept of Baba Yaga and foundations of his character. The dogs scene and the motorcycle chase are flashy but lack substance, reminding me of poor martial arts Chinese movies. Going from bad to worse, the final fights are actually disgusting. Again a great movie turned into a franchise is not always a recipe for success.",

High table and ex-communicado. And fight scenes are like the movie makers were so lazy so they shot only one sequence of fight scene and copy pasted it 100 times.\nEverytime k.reeves or h.berry seems to give an impression the person they are going to meet could kill them just because they went to meet him but then shows that person and his army has been defeated by them even without them had to plan or prepare. Why in the first place they act like they are afraid of them if they knew they both could easily eliminate him and his army that too at his place if it comes to that. Ridiculous.

Well if JW can kill a whole army then there's no stakes, if there are no stakes, then there's no need to be invested because I know he'll win every fight. f Which means no tension and hence the movie just gets boring.Also the fight scenes went on for way too long. a 5 minute fight scene is way more interesting than a 20 minute fight scene, the whole movie actually felt like a fight scene, which is not interesting if you've seen the first 2 movies",

Or whatever hard, semi-hard, or sharp object might be laying nearby.John Wick 3 is simply a continuation of the story and action that we've grown to love from the first 2. This one may not have quite the same heart as JW1 or even JW2, but the action is easily as good and maybe sometimes better. With each movie, I become more and more impressed with the fight choreography, creativity, and camera work. It's really amazing to watch. For reference, my favorite movie of all time happens to be The Matrix - mostly for the underlying themes and visuals - but also for the action. In John Wick 3, there was actually a moment where I thought to myself, \"John Wick 3 (and/or the series) has surpassed The Matrix as my favorite movie.\" I think I pulled back from that a bit as the movie progressed, but the jury is still out. JW4 is looming. :) Also, this goes without saying, but if you didn't like the other John Wick movies or that style, certainly don't bother. You won't enjoy this one either. John Wick 3 is just more of the same.",

        "text": "For all of those fans of action packed movies & specifically of the \"John Wick\" Series, this is a must watch movie from my end. The reason I say this is mainly because this movie definitely will not let your expectations down.The aspect that I peculiarly like about the film is the action sequences are very well thought of & being made in the sense that they would happen like in a reality. Let me explain by this through a scene from the movie itself: The army of assassins sent by The High Table to kill John Wick were heavily geared up with impenetrable Body Armour. When it came to killing them John had to shoot atleast a minimum of 4-5 bullets in order to kill one person. That too it became easier to kill them once he found out that shooting them in the neck would be better as there is least protection there. This is definitely what you should expect of a scene where the enemies are so heavily armed, having shown that they would've died with one bullet straight would not only be illogical but also disappointing. This theme of showing realistic fighting is seen across the whole of the movie be it the action sequence in the water or the bike chasing scene.I feel it's always better that the action sequences shown in a movie be more focused towards reality rather than just showing fancy-not-so-physics-wise-logical action scenarios. This simply also makes the audience feel more connected to it. I mean people just jumping off of cars & cliffs, throwing hundred kilo stuff at each other does not account for a good action sequence.The story line was pretty simple & carried well across characters & scenes. Obviously I was prepared for the fact that this would be a full-fledged action film & expected it to be no less but some of the actions sequences were just carried on for too long, having no such great importance. Simply speaking they could've just eliminated a few of those & maybe spent that time on the story build ups. There were obviously logically flawed scenes too, which could've been thought of better, one of the main ones being towards the end, the scene on the rooftop (not giving more spoilers there). But in totality the movie was definitely a way forward for the action movies segment.As for the Climax, It did not see that coming & interesting. It does set a tone for the next John Wick movie, Oh Boy, Oh Boy, YES, there is another one on the way, be prepared.I would definitely recommend any of you action enthusiasts to go watch this one, It's definitely worth your penny. Do watch it with your friends jumping off the seats whilst a blast. Ciao.",

The head asian guy acting stupid in the continental was along the same vein. It's almost like they threw everything into this one movie but the kitchen sink. Also he wants to live to remember his wife but they didn't include any scenes to support that. It was like an afterthought. Some fight scenes were reminiscent of the matrix. This was definitely more about the fight and graphic colors which distracted from the storyline and plot. The storyline itself was pretty abundant too and got carried away. Everyone who saw him would be over the top, \"it's an honor to meet you Mr. Wick!\" Seriously and ridiculously exaggerated. Then tried to kill him. I'm seeing it for 2nd time time and it got a little more disappointing. Looks like they are setting up for a #4. Hope they make up for it then.",

It's a movie which I think changes the definition of action we usually are used to watching. The story line of this movie isn't very strong one, in my opinion - not going to lie on that - but overall, I liked it and don't regret watching it, thinking I wasted 2 hours of my life. In fact, it actually kept me entertained as it continued and also kept me curious enough to watch through the whole time without even me wondering for once that, what am I watching!I would also like to add that although the situations portrayed to us are very ideal and maybe none of those would work at all or only 20-30% would be possible in real life scenarios, but still, cannot ignore that it's a great watch and hey, we should also not forget the fact that that's what movies are for ultimately, entertainment, aren't they? Alongside, I believe it also might be worth mentioning about the classic dark theme of this movie's franchise, which is continued from previous parts and was just as appealing as it gets - along with the intro music they had (helps in setting the tone to watch it), when it begins.Spoiler:While watching the movie, I liked his survival skills - I am not talking only in the sense of action that happened in it, but he also seems to be having good backups (extra coins, contacts, etc.) everywhere which he uses and survives - and also the way he is able to save himself is just amazing to me. He seems to be able to withstand anything and everything that is thrown at him and beats all the odds of surviving and comes out standing every time. Action in this movie is a lot, and I literally mean, a lot! It has one good thing (I believe) though - it doesn't have an extremely gruesome way of killings in it that some action movies these days have; it doesn't make audience uncomfortable while watching.In conclusion, I'd say it's an overall good movie to watch and you will not get bored, of course with a condition of depending on the type of person you are in terms of love for action. Solid 8/10 from me.",

Halle Berry section though the action was superb but the storyline was bad. John Wick looking for help from Halle Berry with just a marker but the high table against him. i mean she could have been shown as a rebel in hiding or something rather than an active assassin and well settled but still going against high table to help John just because he has a marker. A marker which John himself was not ready to accept in chapter 2 and did so after much hue and cry.\n2. High Table - this is a very stupid scene. King of Kings living in a desert and controlling such vast empire and then he also agrees to let go John if he agrees to kill Winston (Ian Mcshane) and why because he didnt agree to the terms of the high table. John Wick himself is guilty of the same thing. Anyway John agrees to do it and as a token of his apology or repentance, cuts a finger and gives to high table.\n3. Now John Wick is out to kill Winston and 2 minutes into the scene, refuses to kill him and together they take the world apart.\n4. I know John Wick is John Wick but he falls from top storey of hotel after being shot and still doesnt die, i mean c'mon.\nBut one will still be able to watch this once because of action choreography, dialogues and photogrpahy. Those neon lighting did take my breath away and i loved every bit of rain and lighting.",

Second motorcycle chase unrealistic, ok I guess. The Continental fight could all be deleted honestly. Ending fall was epic and the setup. I would have preferred 20 more minutes of revenge and wrapping up the series, getting redundant, not much else to do here but kill a bunch more guys. Not enough dialogue/setup, this one needed better writing. At times messy, sloppy, unclear, confusing, editing. Again started off really well then just fell off a cliff. Disappointed. 5/10 that harsh if I give the first two like 8's. Don't see the point of a 4th other than a money grab, that should have been 20-30 minutes of revenge. So much could have been edited out to make that work.",

Wick 3 throws you into a fast paced cat and mouse game between John and what seems to be the rest of the world. I was pleasantly surprised to see the creative way John used a horse in the midst of fight. The respect that other assassins had for John added depth to the idea that money can influence anything. I didn't care much for the adjudicator because her character fell flat and un intimidating at all but I understood what she represented. I couldn't give Wick 3 a 10 because there were some points in the film that seemed to stall leaving more questions than answers but not enough to ruin the thrill ride.",

        "text": "Going to this movie I expected something fresh , something enjoyable , something interesting. Instead I exited the theater being bored to death.\nIt started nice with John having a 14M dollar bounty on him. At that point I thought that the plot was John surviving the attacks from literally everyone, until that part stopped in 20 minutes or so. After that he tried to accomplish some missions in order to have a normal life.\nThis was the 1/4 of the movie in total, and the other 3/4 was just fight scenes.\nMost of them were too long , unrealistic , and over all boring. In my opinion, we needed more creative kills like the one with the book at the beginning of the movie.\nAlso it needed more jokes. The director didn't even care for the viewers that were bored , and on top of that , he actually tell the viewers that the fights were good, in one scene were John fights with someone in the last 30 minutes of the movie.\nToo much violence. Dont give me wrong, I am a big fan of violence, but it was too much. Dogs biting human balls, knifing an eyeball, or even John cutting his own fricking finger, I almost barfed on that one.\nAnyway I have more issues with the movie , but I dont want to become 100 years old until the end if the review. In conclusion, if you liked the second movie, then you will like this one too, but if you enjoyed the first movie and hated the second one, like me , then I suggest you to skip this one.",

It went against certain action film conventions - the hero was not a muscle bound hulk like a Schwarzenegger or Stallone, the action was super fast paced, the plot was basic and straighforward, but introduced some unique elements, and there was something a bit unique and stylish about the film. John Wick was cool.Then they made a sequel. And while the second film was more ridiculous, less believable, and not as good on any level, it was still John Wick, and still enjoyable.But this third film is out of ideas and is simply rehashing the same things again for a payday (and hey, people seem to like it, so I can't fault them entirely). The magic is gone and it's just another over the top action film. In their attempt to mine more movies out of what was the barest of bare bones plots to start with, they have had to resort to ever increasing gratuitous violence and fight scene gimmicks. I'm no wilting rose, but even I was a bit unsettled by the casual nature of the violence in this film, which surely has one the highest body counts of any film in recent history. It was so over the top it became a bit cartoonish, like watching a video game. There was even the concept of John fighting a series of progressively more important and more difficult \"bosses,\" just like a video game. John Wick 3 is watchable.... but barely.",

We don't know if Derek Kolstad had thought that John Wick would be this big when he first created it, but when we came to the third film it seems clear how the story deepened and became beautiful.This film offers you all kinds of action. The film has a unique style of action. Any action you can think of is included in the third film. Moreover, exponentially! The enemies are increasingly jumping. As we saw in the trailer, there is even a horse escape scene. There's so much more to it. At this point, sometimes there can be a small illusion in the viewer. Only action-oriented films can be considered empty. We can say that John Wick 3 offers almost uninterrupted action for 2 hours and 10 minutes. But in doing so, it doesn't forget the story. You will learn new and very interesting details of John Wick and you will get new ideas about the functioning of the universe.Stahelski has very impressive shots.The main venues preferred for the main fights were especially appreciated. The fact that the director's vision is so blended with Keanu Reeves and other actors is very effective on the traceability of the film. Stahelski deserves great praise.The film also brings new characters. One of them is Sofia, played by Halle Berry. Obviously the audience will love Sofia. Halle Berry has done a great job. Mark Dacascos is one of our main villains; He portrayed the character Zero in the film.Among the action films, it was both a strong story and an ambitious way of action. I think that the action-lovers will be pleasure separated from this film. 9/10",

        "text": "About 6 months ago I saw a picture of the set of 'John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum' featuring Keanu Reeves on horseback shooting at motorcyclists. It was such a great looking shot that I have been waiting eagerly to see how it looked in the actual film ever since. It did not let me down. The style this film possesses is insane. It is one of the best looking action films I have ever seen.The pacing of this film is also incredible. It starts the action immediately and almost never lets up. I can't wait to see what the death count was in this film because it will be truly enormous. The only problem is when the death count is that high the film can struggle to keep the originality up. After a while each death starts to look very similar to the last, and the 50 before that, and it can even become a little tedious to watch.The only other flaw I came across with the film was that John Wick is on the defence too much. Instead of being angry and on the hunt like the first two films, for the majority of the Chapter 3 he is in survival mode. Still very fun to watch, but it isn't quite the same as seeing him take brutal revenge.And the film is brutal. I could be wrong but I don't remember the first two entries in the series making me cringe in terms of violence as much. There were some very hard things to watch at times in this movie even for me, and I pride myself on handling those sorts of things fine most of the time. One of them early on got an audible gasp from the entire audience and I saw multiple people having to turn their heads to the side.'John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum' is two hours of your life that will pass by very quickly. This is as non-stop action as films get. I think this is the third best action series currently producing movies (after 'James Bond' and 'Mission Impossible'). Will it get a third one? The first entry on the trivia page suggests no, however the end of this movie suggests yes? I guess we will have to wait to find out. For now enjoy the hell out of this one.",

        "text": "Following on from two deliriously entertaining, visually gorgeous and blissfully simplistic thrillers, John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum keeps up the franchise's unique appeal in stunning fashion. Complete with electrifying action, beautiful cinematography, a pulsating score and a great sense of humour, the film is pretty much as purely joyful as action thrillers get, and proves two hours of brilliant entertainment.Before I get into all of that, though, one of the greatest things about this franchise is just how simplistic it is. You may have seen John Wick and John Wick: Chapter 2, you may not have done. Going into this third film, however, it's all pretty irrelevant, and while the first two films are certainly worth your time, absolutely anybody can go and watch this movie without any prior knowledge, and simply sit back and watch the fireworks.The plot is effectively laid out for you in the first ninety seconds of the movie. John Wick is excommunicated, and there's a $14m bounty on his head. That's it. Following that brief bit of exposition are two hours of beautifully simple yet endlessly entertaining action, and while the film does keep you engrossed with its sense of mystery and intrigue surrounding this world of allegiances and deception, it's the thrill of the chase that really matters.In that, there's almost never a moment where storytelling takes precedence over action thrills, with the movie bursting into life by way of an exhilarating opening act. However, much like the first two films, not every moment is fighting and shootouts, with the mystery, the tension and the intrigue all playing a part as John Wick encounters numerous people from his past in all manner of different scenarios.There are moments in its middle portion that do drag a little more than others, and where the story perhaps gets a little self-indulgent, however there's no denying just how slick and purely entertaining a thriller this is regardless.Of course, the action itself is brilliant as well. The opening act is astonishing, filled to the brim with insane action that features seamless fight choreography, brilliant camerawork and a fantastic sense of self-awareness that allows you to laugh at the most ridiculous moments. From then on, the film continues to burst into life with mad, energetic and dazzling action sequences again and again, only furthering the sheer entertainment appeal of the whole affair.Also, there's no getting away from just how good-looking a movie this is. The camerawork in the fight sequences is certainly excellent, but it's the film's kaleidoscopic colour pallette and slick cinematography that makes it a feast for the eyes, pulling off the style of a pure pulp thriller in brilliant fashion once again, and with a pulsating, intense score playing throughout to boot, you'll definitely be on the edge of your seat from beginning to end.All in all, John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum isn't much different from the previous two movies. It isn't the world's most intricate or intelligent thriller. However, with brilliant energy, dazzling visuals, stunning action and an invaluable sense of fun, absolutely none of that matters, and it instead proves a solidly entertaining, manic and dizzyingly joyful thriller throughout.",

Most action movies you see is filled with ridiculous amounts of shaky-cam, fast edits and way over-the-top fights. This is perfect. You can see all action clear as day, and by god the stuns in this film are extraordinary. Why the Academy Awards don't award talent like this is beyond me. There were times that I wondered if they had used CGI, because someone nuts must be willing to throw themselves from motorbikes and through glass. But whatever case it is, its a dam joy to watch.As with the previous 2 installments, John Wick 3 is where Keanu Reeves is at home. This role was just made for him, and watching him stand toe to toe with powerhouses like Halle Berry, Ian McShane, Laurence Fishburne and Anjelica Huston, not only shows how good he is as an action star, but as an actor in general. He hasn't been given a role this good since the Matrix, but those movies never showed how good he was just at acting. He sells this movie.The supporting cast is all amazing, and I loved how they left their character's hanging, giving us hope of seeing them in future installments. I also loved how more in-depth the movie spent on world-building. The way it brings in different cultures into this assassin guild is done very well.John Wick 3 is an amazing action movie that never loses its steam throughout, and its 2 hour run times flies past, because of non-stop action that is directed and choreographed to perfection. I can't wait to see if they manage to pull off the 4th like they did here.8.8/10",

Zero plot, typical anti-male female characters, ridiculous levels of gore beyond what is needed. It's a clear indication that either the population is getting dumber that we have so many 10/10 reviews for this movie, or people are being paid to post positive reviews.Either way I do not recommend this movie if you have an IQ of over 50 as you will just get bored and walk out like a lot of people did when I watched it.",

Is it it's characters, is it ability to create fantastic choreography or maybe new, shiny special effects. Is it sound design or perhaps a good story ? What will elevate action movie to a new heights? What you need to do to create an instant classic? John Wick 3 creators might not have found all the answers but they definitely created something special and unique.John Wick Parabellum is a direct continuation to the previous movie. It picks up just after 2nd movie finishes, just when John Wick is about to be made excommunicado. The first 20 minutes of the movie are really special and I enjoyed it immensely. John Wick needs to escape from the never ending wave after wave of assassins who try to collect very large bounty put on his head. In a city filled with assassins controlled by secretive yet very powerful and feared organization this is not an easy task. Assassins are everywhere here, on every corner of every street, which actually begs a question. Are there are any normal people left in the world?The stunts from the start to finish were really special, some of them really unique and brutal. People were gasping in the cinema, me including. The sheer unfiltered violence and constant fight for survival, this movie does this well. There was even a fantastic sequence featuring German shepherds, the scene with the dogs added more excitement to brutal showcase of John Wick's and Halle Berry's gun skills. It felt like a continues shot, maybe even it was. When camera was rolling and following dogs attacking army of villains, this was very fluid and kept me on my toes from start to finish. Let me tell you this again, this movie does this sort of action really, really well.Where it falls short is the actual story. There was an opportunity here to do more with the story, unfortunately it took a backstage here or maybe even left the fast moving Wick's car and stayed on the side lines as what we got here is a predictable plot with predictable twists and really not that interesting main character. Even Polar has better story than JW. John's motives are confused here, his choices do not make much sense and his strategic thinking leaves a lot to be desired.It does not work for John's benefit, it makes him rather not so special - a flat and shallow character, apart of amazing survivability skills he has nothing else to offer. Is he really just a blunt weapon, tip of the spear, instrument of destruction. What is the whole point of this destructive adventure? We have here this faceless organization, their cruel motives and ways, their world dominance. Movie fails to explain this to us more. The story and subsequently the movie is lacking depth !Remember that this is a pure action movie, however special it is, misses this final piece of the puzzle in its attempt of becoming instant classic and is sadly just punching above waist, becoming average movie which will definitely entertain you but will leave you begging for answer and more, more sense and more emotions. I will keep it simple for you, If action is what you are looking for, you will not be disappointed here.",

        "text": "Directed by stuntmen turned directors Chad Stahelski and David Leitch, and written by Derek Kolstad, the original John Wick (2014) was something of a sleeper hit, earning almost $90 million against a $20 million budget. John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017), however, was a bona fide blockbuster, earning $171 million against a $40 million budget. And now we have John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum, which has maintained the franchise's monetary trajectory, earning $230 million against a $75 million budget.Not bad for a franchise that began life as a story about a guy getting revenge on the thugs who killed his puppy.Except, of course, it wasn't just a puppy.With Stahelski back in the director's chair for the third time, and with a script by Kolstad, Shay Hatten, Chris Collins, and Marc Abrams, as with the previous films, Parabellum is built on the foundation of Keanu Reeves's zen-like stoicism, a quality he can deploy to make a violent sword fight look about as stressful as sleeping on velvet linen with \"Fur Elise\" playing in the background and a cat gently purring on the pillow beside you. And although this third entry in the franchise does flirt with a few themes amidst the mayhem, it's not trying to be something it isn't, well aware of its own identity as a completely over-the-top orgy of violence, wherein the endless deaths by gun, knife, fist, dog, horse, motorbike, sword, pencil, and book of 18th century Russian folklore, are so excessive as to transcend any possible accusations of glorifying violence. In short, the film leans into its status as basically a live-action episode of Itchy and Scratchy. Sure, it can become a little repetitive at times, and there's next to no plot or character development. But that's to ignore how aesthetically accomplished it is, how funny it is, how compelling it is, and how unapologetically entertaining it is.Beginning only moments after Chapter 2 ended and about a week after Chapter 1, Parabellum opens with Wick (Reeves) attempting to flee New York with a $14 million contract on his head. Meanwhile, the High Table dispatch an Adjudicator (Asia Kate Dillon) to look into the unsanctioned help given to Wick by Winston (Ian McShane), Charon (Lance Reddick), and the Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne). To lead the pursuit of Wick, she hires Zero (Mark Dacascos), who hates guns and is a huge Wick fanboy. With every assassin on the planet hunting him, Wick's travels bring him into contact with all manner of characters, including The Director (Anjelica Huston), the former assassin who trained him; Sofia (Halle Berry), the manager of the Casablanca Continental, and an old friend who owes him a favour; Berrada (Jerome Flynn), the Master of Coin and a member of the High Table; and The Elder (Saïd Taghmaoui), the only person above the Table.Okay, first things first, Parabellum looks absolutely gorgeous. Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 both looked great, but Parabellum is in another class altogether and is genuinely one of the best looking films I've seen all year. Part of the reason for this is the symbiosis between the various component parts of the aesthetic - Dan Laustsen's lush cinematography; Kevin Kavanaugh's busy production design and Chris Shriver's complementary art direction; Evan Schiff's relatively slow editing; and Martyn Zub's immersive sound design. The first half of the film, which takes place at night in New York, and is essentially one long almost real-time scene, is rain soaked and bathed in glorious neon (mainly blues, greens, and reds), which reflect off the wetness on the road and bounce back towards their source, creating a dazzling display of light. When Wick nips inside a store, the vibrant colours are pulled out completely, with the brown of the store's walls and cabinets dominating, so when he heads back outside, the richness of the palette really pops. The Moroccan section of the film is predominately gold, brown, and yellow, creating a sense of serenity that contrasts nicely with the hyperactive tone of the New York scenes.In terms of the action, as with the first two films, Parabellum has obviously been heavily influenced by Serbuan maut (2011) and Serbuan maut 2: Berandal (2014), (the presence of Cecep Arif Rahman and Yayan Ruhian is no coincidence). These two films effectively redefined action cinema by shunning frenetic editing in favour of longer takes that showcased the performers' physicality. You know that seizure-inducing scene in Taken (2008) when Mills jumps a fence, and there are literally 15 cuts in five seconds? There's none of that in Parabellum, with the audience allowed to focus on the organic progression of the ballet-like combat. And with Jonathan Eusebio's magnificent choreography paying homage to everyone from Harold Lloyd to Buster Keaton to Andrei Tarkovsky (seriously), Parabellum doesn't just give us rote action scenes, it gives us immersive works of performance art.The film also includes any number of scenes that really shouldn't work, so insane are they. There's a fight in a library during which books become as deadly as knives; a scrap that takes place in an antique knife shop, where Wick and his opponents only realise that they're surrounded by literally hundreds of knives when they run out of ammo; a horse versus motorbike gauntlet (with swords) that has more than a passing resemblance to a similar scene in Aknyeo (2017); a huge to-do in a Moroccan bizarre involving two people and two dogs against a legion of hired thugs; an old-fashioned shootout in the Continental; and a climactic gunfight cum sword fight in a room made entirely of glass. The fact that the film can pull off such ludicrous scenes without becoming a parody of itself is as good a testament to the craft on display as anything.Both previous Wick films have been said to resemble video games in their visual design, and this is even more pronounced in Parabellum, not just in its aesthetic, but in some of its narrative beats. For example, each fight is harder than the last (i.e., the difficulty level increases). A scene in a stable where Wick uses a horse to take out two thugs is essentially an environmental assassination straight out of the Hitman franchise. There's a single driving level (there's always a single driving level), and a non-combat level where Wick must reach his destination before dehydrating. To make it to the final battle, Wick must face down a platoon of heavily armoured soldiers, each of whom requires multiple hits before going down, whilst Wick himself has to pause for a weapon upgrade. Then we have a mini-boss fight, followed by the real boss fight against Zero. And this is not a criticism. On the contrary, part of the film's charm is its resemblance to a violent, hyper-stylized, morally questionable video game in which one must kill waves of faceless opponents.One of the reasons the original film stood out so much was the brilliance of Kolstad's world-building. It wasn't just a movie about a former assassin being pulled back into the trade. Instead, it depicted a fascinating underworld featuring an international Assassin's Guild, a hotel for assassins in which violence is prohibited, even an assassins' currency. In Chapter 2, Kolstad introduced the person who helped Wick retire, the High Table, blood markers, and the Bowery King. Parabellum continues the expansion, introducing the person who trained Wick, the Master of Coin, the Elder, the adjudication process, excommunication, and deconsecration (where a hub is declared no longer a safe space). The mythology has deepened with each film, and the fact that it has so many old-world religious connotations drives home the sense of ancient ideologies being applied to people who must be ultra-modern in their affairs.Are there some problems? Well, any film this violent is going to have immediate detractors. But the thing is, the movie doesn't take itself too seriously, nor does it expect the audience to, so the question of 'irresponsibility' when it comes to violence is kind of a moot point - of course it's irresponsibly violent, it's supposed to be irresponsibly violent. Does it treat guns and knives fetishistically? Yes, to a certain extent it does. Is it celebrating guns and violence in a realistic socio-political manner? No, not in the slightest.Having said that, the violence can occasionally come across as meaningless, insofar as it doesn't seem to have any ramifications for any of the main characters. Related to the disassociation that presenting violence like this can have, there's the problem that simply by virtue of logistics, almost all of Wick's opponents are nameless and faceless extras. The one real criticism I had is that the narrative structure is a little awkward, and on several occasions, actions and decisions reached over the course of multiple scenes are simply undone just a couple of scenes later.This notwithstanding, I absolutely loved Parabellum. Easily the best in the franchise thus far, it's more ambitious, more ridiculous, more violent, and more entertaining. Sure, themes such as fealty, honour, and fate come and go without much engagement. But this is not what the film is about. Instead, Stahelski has crafted an action film that features extraordinary aesthetic elements and a wonderfully vibrant visual design. Parabellum doesn't just unapologetically revel in its excessive violence. It makes art out of its excessive violence.",

Apparently there's some sort of secret society that has a grudge against everybody who hurt its little feelings, but rather than developing that idea in any way, the filmmakers filled up a couple of hours with an interminable series of violent deaths and special effects, mostly taking place in dark or dimly-lit scenes. Unfortunately, I tried to actually watch the movie. Turns out that compiling a body count would have been more interesting. As for Keanu Reeves, his abilities are normally beyond question, but what he does here is NOT acting -- it's just choreography of one fight scene after another. It gets boring mighty fast.

As it was I felt obligated to stay and suffer, although our friendship has been strained as a result. If you like your films with good acting, a well thought out script, well choreographed fight scenes, humorous moments that don't make you roll your eyes, and an audio track that doesn't make you want to cut your ears off then this isn't the movie for you. And I use the term 'movie' loosely, because there's no real beginning, middle or end to John Wick 3, it just ploughs along in one endless stream of drivel. The acting and dialogue are appalling - all from actors that should know better or at least have the self-respect to throw a script like this straight in the bin. The fight scenes and gun play are beyond absurd and endlessly repetitious. It just goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on. Just when you hope it will stop it continues with another deluge of bad guys to be thrown on the floor, shot in the head (reload the gun) then shot in the head a couple of times more. Then there's the blatant plagiarism from the likes of Enter the Dragon and the Man With the Golden Gun. Those movies don't deserve their moments dragged down to this level. I'm assuming the film was part-funded by a glazing company, such was the number of times someone was thrown through a pane of glass. Finally, let's look at Keanu Reeves. I'm sure he's a nice guy, I've got nothing against him, but an action figure he is not... or rather he is in the literal sense, so wooden is his acting, so plastic his repetitive downtrodden expression. They say you learn from your mistakes, well this was a big one for me. Avoid this film like the plague, because after two hours of this garbage you may well be praying for it to take you away. One for the lowest common denominator brigade. How this tripe is currently showing an 8.0 on IMDB is one of life's great mysteries and one for future generations to try and figure out.",

There has been much talk about the class system/hierarchy and how the assassins judicial system works. Well it doesn't make much more sense in this chapter either! The punishments don't fit the crime, and visa versa. The only reason this movie has a leg to stand on is because of a Hollywood budget!

It feels like with Chapter 3, that effect has worn off, at least a little bit. John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is a helluva ride, but one that can't quite maintain a 130 minute runtime, a full 30 minutes longer than the first film. I've never been one to try and say how long certain genre films should be, especially since barriers shouldn't be put on any director if they have a certain goal in mind.With that said, when 80 percent of your movie is high octane gun battles or hand to hand combat fighting, there's only a particular amount of action you can take. Whether or not I liked it, I was subconsciously feeling drained from the experience once the third act kicked in, and that's never a good thing.Couple that with a villain who never feels as much of a threat to Wick as the film wants us to believe, which brings up a bigger issue about the fact that this series hasn't truly found the right match for its titular assassin. Much like the first two films, I can certainly see myself going back and watching individual scenes, particularly the one in the library, the motorcycle chase, and the one with Halle Berry & the dogs, but I don't know that I'm ever going to watch the entire film again. This is not to mention just how ridiculous that ending was, but we can talk more about that once news of a John Wick 4 inevitably arrives. Sigh.6.8/10",

With a $14 million dollar bounty on his head this attracts the attention of every hitman and woman who will do anything they can to get their hands on the cash. With the odds heavily stacked against him Wick needs to utilise all of his skills in order to survive...The first John Wick film was good (not amazing, but the story was reasonable and given the circumstances surrounding Wick's need for vengeance there was a certain emotional investment in Part 1 that made it work quite well). Part 2 wasn't as good with the narrative being a bit muddled and it relied on the action to keep things moving. Part 3 suffers the same problems as Part 2 only on a slightly larger scale..Given the fact that the whole premise sees Wick on the run from a group of hitmen you would think that Part 3 would be a no-brainer and would be wall-to-wall excitement. Whilst it does play out like this to an extent (there are lots of impressive fight sequences), there is no real story to back up the action meaning that the film is literally all style and no substance.One other problem with this film is what they have done with the character of John Wick; he's always being tough, but as the franchise has progressed he's gone from being tough to being 'unbelievably tough' and the film sadly seems to have gone down the 'Rambo' route with its lead character. Don't get me wrong the fight sequences do impress and give the film some energy, but at times Wick feels more like a superhero than a person (the final rooftop sequence only reinforces this point).Reeves impresses again in the action stakes, but as with the second film he just doesn't look all that interested and only puts in an OK performance. Fishburne gets a larger role in this one and seems to at least enjoy himself giving a slightly hammy performance. Berry still looks great for her age, but doesn't add an awful lot to the film. McShane is good, but is in comfortable territory and everyone else gives reasonable performances.One thing that I do appreciate with the John Wick films is the effort that is put into the fight sequences; the choreography is excellent and is worthy of praise. It's a pity really that (aside from the first film) I've not bore witness to a decent story to compliment the impressive action. For this reason the film does suffer quite a bit when Keanu isn't kicking butt due to the bland and uninvolving narrative.",

        "text": "Parabellum is Latin for \"prepare for war\" and also the name of the odd firearm or two, so giving how the last film ended, they are both incredibly apt to be included in the title of John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum. Across two films, John Wick has certainly gone to war after being brought out of retirement, killing many in the process however, the war he has to prepare for in Parabellum is unlike anything we've seen before.Having killed a member of the international assassin's guild on the grounds of the Continental Hotel, the one act that can never be undone, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) goes on the run from an elite band of hit men and women everywhere, all after the $14 million price tag put on his head.John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum feels like a celebration of the action genre, showing no franchise fatigue and referencing a number of great action films in the process, even a nod to the original action man, Buster Keaton, graces the film in its opening moments. The first two films delivered hard-hitting action but Parabellum takes it to a whole new level for the franchise, with books, horses and dogs playing a major part in doing so.It's the meticulousness of the choreography and the energy of the cinematography from Dan Laustsen that brings the masterful action sequences to life, the pulsating motorbike chase/sword fight being the crowning glory of Parabellum. It's a welcome reminder of the genius of the stunt work that goes into making films like these and how it's about time they should be seeing much more recognition for their work come awards season.Parabellum maintains a rather cutthroat pace throughout, right from the frantic opening half hour through to the brutality of the final act. There's a lot more humour on show in this instalment, which works due to how ludicrous some of the action has now become, and the world of the assassins is expanded upon a bit more, which comes as no surprise with a television show to about the Continental Hotel network on the horizon.Nothing encapsulates John Wick as much as Keanu Reeves does, a man who has been in his fair share of classics from the action genre. As the titular character, Reeves may not deliver the greatest acting performance but he does deliver one hell of a physical performance in Parabellum, months of training coming to fruition with a more believable experience for the audience.Suspend your disbelief and strap yourself in because John Wick is back in spectacular fashion. Over the course of three films, he's earned his place in the action hero hall of fame in a franchise that should be regarded as one of the greatest within the action genre.",

        "text": "This year in my life was nothing but a bad luck. I got sick with a flu this year for three months, I have lied in my bed on New Year's eve. Now my tooth hurts me In my mouth and I have full of swelling in my mouth, tomorrow I am going to the dentist for the third time this year. I went with my friend previous week in Wednesday seeing John Wick 3 - Parabellum in movie teather and it was worth it the only good thing this year has happened in my life in a long time seeing the only best action film of 2019.This was the second Keanu Reeves movie I saw in movie teather. 20 years ago I went watching with my late mom The Matrix in movie teather. John Wick 3 is the second Keanu Reeves movie I saw. I am Hughe fan of the man and I love John Wick movies. My favorite of the trilogy is John Wick Chapter 2 I love the second movie to death, it is in my top 15 favorite action films. If i ranked them from best to worst is John Wick 2, than 3 and than 1. This is the best action trilogy I saw I would say is better than The Matrix trilogy I do love all three Matrix films but love John Wick trilogy more, I love them more. I wanted to see John Wick Chapter 2 in movie teather but that movie come at the wrong place in my home town I am happy I went to see this movie in movie teather instead.About the movie: John Wick: Chapter 3 continues the story where the second movie left off. John Wick is now a marked man since everyone is searching for him in New York his hour is almost up and his time is running out. Now with people who owned him a favor which he has a marker escapes to Casablanca and searchers for help from his old friend Sofia (Halle Berry) who is forced to get back in a world of assassins helping John Wick to get his bounty off his back and get his normal life back. John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is a bad-ass non stop action hero in a decade. You have smaurai assassins in here trying to kill John Wick, you have gang on motorcycles trying to kill John Wick. You have John Wick driving a motorcycle, you have John Wick riding a horse. I have saw motorcycle assasinss and riding a horse in Hard Target and Hard Boiled John Woo movies the only movies I saw and of course Cobra (1986) my favorite Stallone action film.The cast: You have Laurence Fishburne, Mark Dacascos, Halle Berry and Yayan Ruhian from The Raid. Ecxcellent action sequnces, stunts performences they are practical and done for real. A lot of martial arts I saw a clip from Keanu Reeves and Halle Berry training together. The cast and acting was beautiful stunning and phenomenal.Keanu Reeves best performence ever since The Matrix and I would say In my opinion John Wick 3 - Parabellum is better than the original John Wick movie. Halle Berry is sexy and beatifully gorgeous woman ever. I love her performence and I love her. My favorite action sequences is in which Keanu Reeves fights Ninjas: Mad Dog vs Man Mad about Dog. Great martial art choreographer, 2 ninjas from the Raid against John Wick. Chad Stahelski directed perfectly this action masterpiece he did a competent job. I love the music score performed on the end of the credits Bullet Holes by Bush. I really wish to get this movie on Blu-ray and DVD.John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is now the benchmark, for action, choreography, and fight scenes, It is phenomenal arguably the best action film in 2019 my favorite I love this film. I don't regret seeing this movie in movie teather. Keanu Reeves is my favorite action star I love him to death.",

This film is just John Wick on the run with the world's top assassins after him, no other story or character development. From the beginning, it is just dozens of assassins popping out of every doorway, long choreographed fights with JW attacked by a half-dozen goons at a time, lots of shooting & knife-throwing in which he kills them all. That's it. It becomes boring after 20 mins, but goes on for 2 hours of the same with barely a spoken word. The occasional spoken line is delivered woodenly & tiredly. Like I said, absolutely no story or depth of character. Boring.",

I mean, gruesomely kill several people in the packed New York subway and no one notices a thing? And bodies disappear when angle is switched. Come. On.The whole movie had a huge \"Ultraviolet\" feeling. Just pile random characters on, and then slaughter most of them without much of a development or explanation how they fit in the plot. Rush somewhere, kill everyone in sight, cut to the next scene which is just the same as the last one. Over and over and over until the cliche \"end\" which was just an opening for the Chapter 4 movie.I loved the first one, second one was a bit over the top, this one was just ridiculous top to bottom. The movie was actually interrupted because of some false alarm at the theatre five minutes before the end. If it was more than that we would not bother going back in to finish watching it.The biggest joke of itself was the character Zero moment at the bench. It felt like cut out of Despicable Me. The only thing missing there was the Squid Launcher. And he is supposed to be THE toughest thug in the movie? Pull the other one, it has bells on.Three stars for the Morocco fight scene, that was a beauty. But it did not save me and my wife exchanging \"are you bored too?\" glances half the time anyway, so no more than that.",

The second one was ok, but this one relies so heavily on the John Wick character that there really is not much left. Reeves plays a great John Wick, but he really is the only reason to go and see this movie because you have already seen this movie.In my opinion, there is absolutely no character or plot development left in the John Wick films. The plot is the same and the action is so over the top with such a lack of any sort of realism that I nearly fell asleep waiting for the movie to end.",

If you want endless armies of Hollywood extras being brutally and graphically murdered - this is YOUR FILM. If you like choreographed fights that go on FAR longer than they should - this is your film. If you want emotion, you won't find it here. Plot? Like the first one, HAHAHAHA. People want to kill John Wick so he has to kill all of them and more to stay alive. That's about it. Oh there are diversions - nice to see Halle Barry in a new roll but even her dog is shot. (Not really). Then onto endless killing scenes and more killing scenes and more and more. Plot pause, 7 lines of dialogue and more killing scenes. It goes on forever!!! American cinema has descended into mindless blood junk 1 out 10 - don't waste your time or money.",

The stunt team did its best work of all three movies. Keanu Reeves, Halle Berry, Mark Dacascos and all the other stunt men were just beyond great, simply incredible.The story was pretty simple as we got what we expected but also so much more, a bigger/detailed look on how big and unique the world that Derek Kolstad created back in 2014 truly are. It's a perfect story and world for an action movie and the filmmakers behind the movies show it once again here; an unpredictable, suspenseful, terrific and entertaining ride filled with great characters, writing and fight choreography.",

You just know there's revenge a coming! Cue rapid action, tears, hatred, killing and revenge. Then a second John Wick movie. Cue hatred, mass killing (on steroids) and, of course, more revenge. BUT NOW there's the third installment of the amazing Mr Wick!! Cue mass, rapid, mindless, never-ending, ultra-graphic killing. Never mind a plot. That's worthless at this point! This fantasy - farce doesn't need one... it's the most vivid single - shooter video game out today. Imagine the worst shooting scenarios possible, add Russian ballerinas, unstoppable street killings, some really pissed dogs, a camel, some sand and a mystical Moroccan mixed in with an unremarkable Asian assassin who never tires and loves his job too much.......and you have John Wick III.\nMINDLESS and MORONIC. Even for a video game.\nDon't waste your time. John Wick, the original, has been molested.",

I think you what you meant to say was uneven, because that makes sense and what you just said is just stupid.The constant whooshing sound you hear isn't knives and fists whizzing through the air, because those don't make any sound except in horrible chop-socky films, it's the sound of brain matter shooting out of the collective skulls of viewers.The woman with no hair plays the exact same character she does in Billions.",

And, honestly, I can't stand the reviews that take a John Wick film and pretend that they expected something like Chinatown walking in.You know the ones I'm talking about, those reviews that lament the fact that they got a brainless action movie when they sat down to watch a brainless action movie.If I said \"I'm not that deep\" I'd be giving them too much credit. So rather than saying that, I'm going to say that, when I sat down to watch it, I didn't lie to myself and pretend it was going to be anything more than a John Wick film.What you have is sleek, beautifully choreographed action brought to you in the most brutal of ways and delivered in a form that requires you to suspend your disbelief because it is just the right amount of totally unrealistic.Does it have a plot? Yeah, but not really. It has just enough of a plot to make a loose story and not so much that it would get in the way of what was promised to be carnage candy.And, honestly, carnage candy is the promise that the John Wick people gave us and nothing more... and each installment of the franchise delivers on that promise. It never, ever, claims that it is anything more than an action film, and it never, ever pretends to be anything deeper.It isn't a great film. It never claims to be. But it is a great action film, so you have to take it for what it is.",

        "text": "Para bellum - prepare for war (Latin - English). John Wick is back for more than two hours of hardcore violence with a hint of comedy spiced with exhilaratingly exhausting chases all over the globe. Chad Stahelski's John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is an epic pandemonium, made to satisfy fans of this franchise, but also to surprise the non-believers with his superbly choreographed fight sequences.This chapter starts where the last film ended. Wick is running out of time and in less than an hour he will be excommunicated from the global community of assassins and can't use any of their hideouts or facilities anymore. Every assassin in New York will be hunting him down - since the price on his head is a staggering $14 million.If you really think assassins have the patience to wait until the High Table (the global organisation of assassins) tells you the hunt has begun, you're in for a surprise. There's killers everywhere and Wick bumps into one very tall man early on in a library, for some close-up combat with books. It doesn't take long before the next battle starts in an antique store where cabinets get shattered to start a lethal knife throwing sequence with deadly consequences.Our man knows he can't keep battling an entire city of assassins forever, he goes looking for a way out and this is where we get to know a bit more about John himself. Anjelica Huston plays a cold-blooded woman who knows John from a previous life. After handing her a talisman he once earned for doing something terrible, he's here to ask for a favour - sneak him out of the US. They owe him that one thing, and Wick is off to Morocco to get rid of his death sentence.Once arrived in North Africa, we get another look at Wick's lost past we know so little about. He has another marker/medallion in his pocket, to collect another favour. This one is destined for Sofia (Halle Berry, reminding us how bad ass she still is), whose daughter he rescued from an unspecified danger long ago. She has a pair of German shepherds who steal the show as bad guy's genitals butchers. The cinematography here is breathtaking, especially when we get to the Sahara and see Wick climbing the dunes in his suit. It's an action packed act that makes you ready for what you're about to witness back in New York City.A representative of the High Table has already arrived in the city and is here to punish those who helped Wick break the rules in the last film. The \"Adjudicator\" (Asia Kate Dillon) gives both the king of the Bowery's bums (Laurence Fishburne) and director of assassins' hotel The Continental, Winston (Ian McShane), seven days to put their affairs in order before they're removed from their roles. Whatever that may mean. While Wick was on his way back, the Adjudicator visited some sidewalk sushi bar and hired the chef/hitman to lead a crew of assassins that will make an end to John Wick's legacy once and for all.Zero (Mark Dacascos) and his crew, are fans of the legendary Wick. While they fangirl in between throwing him through glass walls, they're still here to finish him off. This final showdown happens in Winston's all-glass administrative offices, where nothing is what it seems. Playing with cold glass walls and neon lights has never been more impressive and fun. Even when everything gets smashed to smithereens.With every chapter, this franchise gets bolder and more impressive. This bares the question if they can keep this level of excitement going like other successful franchises, or if this is Reeves' magnum opus as Wick?! I'd say \"dulce periculum\" and keep them coming. Let his legacy live on!",

Many of the fight scenes looked like role-play with actors waiting to time their moves and choreograph punches and throws (the fights in the glass rooms were especially bad) and all the characters (including Wick) getting shot and cut multiple times and still fighting full force for long lengths of time, as well as, having obvious moments that they could have easily killed Wick or vice-a-versa multiple times. All of that added to the completely fake fighting, just got convoluted and boring. I mean obviously JW movies aren't realistic but this one is ridiculous and not fun like the previous two movies. To top it off, the script was terrible and made Halle Berry's character very disappointing, as well as some other lame, new characters...except the dogs, loved them. Also, they leave the ending completely set up for John Wick 4... but it might be time to put this Boogeyman to rest In My Humble Opinion! 10/2019 4.5 stars for this one (compared to 7.5 for the first move)",

        "text": "If you expecting a good sequel then watch John Wick 3. Sometimes it is better than previous. Movie starts with action at a library where john wick fights a tall man (Boban Marjanovic, height 7.3\"). This scene definitely reminds you Jaws (tower heighted and having steel teeth) in Roger Moorey's James bond movie. And our weapon less John Wick fights him with only a book! Followed by this another action scene in a shop of ancient weapons. You can't hold you breathe during brutally fight scene. Again John fights with horse in another fight sequence having swordsmen on bike ! Next is waiting to you a very impressive and powerful character 'Adjudicator 'played by a non binary actor. You will be known the nasty rules of the criminal worlds where there is no mercy to none. Then you meet Sofia (Halle Berry) a mysterious assassin who helps John Wick on some conditions. Then both fights with the help of dogs. Thus movie totally grips you and never let you to leave your seat with unfolding many suspense and surprises till end. Must watchable. As me there are more powerful characters than hero in this movie. Surprises do not stop here, you will see Yayan Ruhian (Raid 1 & 2 fame), Tiger Hu Chen, Mark Dacascos. Climax is good and end with twist. Overall it is best action thriller. In acting side Keanu Reeves is best in his super assassin role rather than acting. Surprised casting is Asia Kate Dillon impressed in their glorious role of head of assassin world with fearful eyes acting. Halle Berry is perfect assassin. Laurence Fishburne has a small role but he may be spared for future. (you will find what I mean while watching) Ian McShane is always good and his manager (Lance Reddick) is perfect in his role with decent body language. End is open and we hope that part number 4 must be taken place in future. I actually want to see it twice. Viewers must watch, if you watch previous parts then you will find new dimension of criminal world with new characters. And have not seen anyone the not to worry, see this one first and then previous you will definitely enjoy them.",

The partnership with John was amazing when they fought.Overall John Wick is a God who cannot be killed. Their were intense scenes with bulletproof armor army and John Wick killed them.

        "text": "John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum, directed and produced by Chad Stahelski was yet another enjoyable, and gritty addition to the John Wick series. The story once again picks up where it leaves off, but it wasn't as slow paced as the second. I appreciate how Stahelski & Kolstad always develop their stories from before, but this time around, it may have been a little too scattered around. For this rare occasion, you can watch this film without seeing the first two of the series, and still enjoy it for what it is because of how stylish, and energetic it is. The action continued it's grimy and creative style, with insane hand to hand combat.Derek Kolstad brought aboard Chris Collins, Marc Abrams & Shay Hatten to assist him with the script, and this was probably my favorite out of the bunch. For the first time in the series, there was a few tongue and cheek moments, and that new strategy paid off.Saad Fekhari did a phenomenal job casting all the talent this film had, including Halle Berry, Ian McShane, Laurence Fishburne, Mark Dacascos, Asia Kate Dylan, Lance Reddick, and more! The only true issue I had with the film, I just did not like the last 5 minutes. It was an obvious set up for a fourth film, and just seemed thrown together last minute.Overall, I enjoyed this film more than the second, but it just didn't hold the weight the first one did.",

Unlike the prequels,John Wick chapter 3 is fundamentally an hour long film at the most that has been dragged out for double that time by fight scenes. Action packed seems an overstatement when a story line is unable to provide a foundation for such action. Instead, John Wick finds himself in one gun battle wherein, armed with one hand held pistol, fires off countless number of shots, before a brief clip of him stumbling to reload once in a ten minute gun fight, seems to break any mood that this unrealistic fantasy could be anything else but unrealistic instead of some spoof. For me the story wore thin and would certainly be worth another 2/3 more ratings with either half the length of the film or more meat in the story line.",

My one issue with the previous film was that some action scenes had got quite blurry to follow. However, this film improves both on the action and the cinematography, while also not losing the grip on the story that is perfect enough to connect the set-pieces.Right from the first scene to the very last, JW 3 had me amazed. This time some light, natural humor was also added, making it different than the first two movies. Also, every single action sequence is super-impressive, mind-blowing, outstanding, crowd-pleasing, heart-pounding, eye-popping... there's no shortage of adjectives to describe the brilliance of the action. I mean this is seriously a next-level action flick that's also filled with gorgeous visuals.Keanu Reeves is just impressive. He IS John Wick. Period.If you miss the days of American action classics where one hero used take on everyone by himself and saved the day (including Keanu's own film Speed), you would be happy to realize this film pays a perfect tribute to those classics, such as Die Hard. And if you call yourself an action buff but haven't seen or planned to see JOHN WICK 3, you're lying. Go, watch it ASAP!I can call it the best R-rated action film of the year. The IMAX experience was pretty much worth it, although the standard screen experience won't feel too different either, to be honest. The film here has been censored so we did miss some of the brutal action, and what's worse is that viewers could feel what got cut and I could hear them making kinda disappointed voices. But even after that, this is a perfect action masterpiece that's going to be remembered for ages to come. This is the closest an American action film can get to Indonesian action classics The Raid 1&2.",

This one however blows them both away in terms of silliness. He should be embarrassed at this point. He cant act. We know this. He cannot deliver a line plain and simple. The director should quit making movies. Even decent actors seems like amateurs under his direction. Halle Berrys scenes were atrocious. She seriously fired 100 bullets while maybe reloading once. The scenes seemed to be choreographed in slow mo if only for the sake of \"i thought this up last night, so im adding it to this fight scene today\". Half the time the actors look like they are waiting to be kicked into the glass panel or patiently allowing JW to get his bearings so he can kill them next. I implore people to watch it only so we can get this unbelievable high rating down where it belongs.",

Doubtful. It shows his natural clumsiness, for no good reason, other than to slow down his final action scene?\nI am embarrassed for Keanu and this script.

Also, the world-building of this underground assassin society adds so much to this franchise and really helps make it stand out from others.

Wick reaches down from the horse lol and takes the guy's own gun from his belt!! then shoots him with it. I mean, someone wanna tell me why that dude didnt shoot em instead of try and pull him off?... I was thinking this and crying inside before he even tried to pull Wick off!! Then next guy on bike is next to Wick and JUST after Wick does a little pathetic \"flair\" shot, the guy runs into a car. So The guy is blind too? I guess it kinda looked cool, but it's improbability and the implication of incompetence and stupidity by \"the others\" is exactly what is wrong with this movie. There is no thought into the texture, the substance. No consideration for \"likely\" or \"plausible\".And the worst part is most of what happens isn't even additive to the storyline and gets taken back in the next scenes...Bah I mean, I enjoyed first two, but this is some serious visual and mental jibber jabber....",

The dialogue while sparse, is almost crafted to seem unintentionally witty. With that said, this was the weakest installment. Still an amazing movie, but could have been written better and tightened up a bit. I hope this does not become a franchise they ruin with rushed movies to meet some arbitrary deadline. If they can continue to finely craft these movies, this will be one of the best movie universes that Hollywood has conjured up. Thoroughly enjoyed this movie, it was funny, fun to watch how John Wick takes care of his business, and I'm excited to see where story goes from here. And Halle Berry's dogs, awesome addition. They steal the show.",

Starting immediately after the second this film introduces more lore or should I say more meaningless bs. The first film was simple, you killed his dog and it does not matter who you are Wick is coming for you. The second got a bit more gloopy with dodgy criminal moral logic but it was entertaining. This 3rd film,takes all of that to a new level whilst leaving the audience to wonder why simplicity got so complicated. It has a knowing smugness, rather like somebody tweaked audience pleasing sections a little too hard so they wear a little thin very quickly. The worst introduction of all is the character of the Adjudicator, so camp a performance it really turned the whole movie into , ahem, a parody of itself.",

Not without moments of clarity, it is nevertheless unoriginal and lacking of previously well established intellect. The repetitive & terribly contrived storyline compares poorly to the previous films. You will certainly be saying \"Why didn't John just...\" on more than one occasion. At this point, it appears quite the overbaked ham, rehashing successful scenes from the first two films - and more than one Bruce Lee movie for good measure.The ending, you ask? Ludicrous and shamefully dishonest to established character development. Any salvation that \"John Wick 4\" could bring to the franchise might as well be imbued with magic, aliens, or social justice - just to keep things fresh (Tongue-in-cheek, of course. Please don't. Some things really are a bridge too far.)Inspirations: I left with a belly full of popcorn, and an itch to start running. This won't end well.",

        "text": "Seriously? What did I watch? I need to emphasize that I loved the first two installments of John Wick; but this movie is just overblown.\nWhere to begin? The movie starts where we left off, everyone wants to kill Wick, because he violated his contract for killing at the Hilton. That sounds good, but it gets old very quick. Everyone in New York is an assassin who can be stopped by a gold coin. What's dumb, is because since when do criminals have such high honour? I'm sure you'll get a fringe or rouge group eventually, to kill Wick if they hate him enough; despite his gold coin.Second, the police force in this world is non existent. You have guys shooting up city blocks and nobody calls the cops; not to mention the piles of dead bodies. In the earlier films, most death scenes happened in some privacy. Here most civilians don't even see bothered that people are shooting up a busy street.\nOn top of it, how can no one kill this guy? Wick gives them countless opportunities, yet they just wait for him to get back up.The biggest problem to me is, John Wick cannot die. The dude was shot, stabbed, run over, thrown through glass, fell several floors, and fell off a building and he just brushed it off. I understand it's a movie, but this whole movie came off as tongue and cheek; this made Arnold movies seem realistic.\nGoing back to \"The Table\" who runs this, and why does everyone take orders from them? In real life, Mafia groups war with each other, constantly. Nobody can just shoot these couple of leaders and it's over? Considering how honour bound everyone is, they probably wouldn't even fight back, if you take a step onto a safe haven.\nIn the end all of this could be forgivable, if it wasn't so boring. The action gets so overused you get tired of seeing it. Wick constantly brushing off death, gets old when you realize he can't die, and the Table's politics are beyond laughable. In the end, it'll please the summer action crowd; but that's about it.",

        "text": "This is the 3rd installation of the \"Wick\" franchise and this one definitely implodes on itself IMO. Parabellum meaning: prepare for war, so that kind of sets the mood for the whole movie; war and preparing for war. So, don't expect any witty repartee or philosophy on life type dialogue. The whole movie is like \"Lord of the Rings: the desolation of smaug\" ...desolation did indeed ensue. 'John Wick: Chapter 3-Parabellum' starts with Wick running and the whole movie doesn't stop to take a breath from there. Lots of kicking, hitting, chopping, punching, stabbing, slashing, shooting and killing interspersed with some banal dialogue; rinse and repeat. The added attraction of karate dogs (taken to a whole new level) are fresh and interesting. I laughed out loud when Wick quoted a 'Matrix' line when asking about guns. But overall, this film is basically a karate movie only with more white people and people of color. There are some big Hollywood names which I think were added to give the film some street cred and Keanue Reeves some added star support and box office draw. Speaking of which, was that a tire around Keanue's belly & a double chin? The music is loud and the dialogue is not, so be prepared with a remote to adjust volume if you wait for the streaming version. This is the kind of movie you get when rich foreign investors mess with Hollywood scripts and think they can direct just cuz they have a big budget. Its not without humor, Mostly from its own inflated self-importance and winks/nods to Wick fans. I give it 4 1/2 - 5 stars for sheer audacity.",

From the first frame a contract is out on John Wick and for the entire movie all that happens is people get killed. My wife and I love the genre so violence and blood are fine but not ONLY violence and blood. I feel let down my my IMDB peeps because I always read the reviews for over 45 years old and they were around 8.0. Anything above 7.0 is usually great. How can Adults over 45 give a high score to a movie with NO STORY?I went back and watched the Wick 2 which I had never seen and it appeared to have a little more story than 3 but nowhere near as much as 1. I assume this is because 18 year olds are OK with a movie that has no story but how can 45+ year olds be OK with that? The producers are just phoning it in.Very frustrating!",

        "text": "If you thought super-assassin, man of few words, dog fan and one man punching bag John Wick had run out of energy after 2 weeks of carnage across John Wick and John Wick 2 then think again, as Wick (aka 54 year old Keanu Reeves) is back bigger, badder and madder than ever to wreak havoc across New York City (and the world) in the Hollywood action romp of the year, John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum.It's incredible to think of where the Wick brand has come from, from the surprising success of the first film that no one thought would be worth much of a look, through to the more excessive and large-scale 2nd installment that expanded the lore and universe that Wick is a part of, to now full-scale Hollywood budget and flair, John Wick just keeps getting bigger and better.Re-teaming with stunt-man turned director Chad Stahelski, Reeves and his directing partner have ensured that Parabellum (a title that will make sense once you watch the film, trust me) is a film like no other with its completely over the top and highly unbelievable antics needing to be seen to be believed and if my cinema experience is anything to go by, prepare to be wincing, laughing and clapping your way through their gloriously energetic and thrill infused imaginations.With more headshots than a police database, more devilishly entertaining acting turns from a returning main cast plus new additions such as Halle Berry (and some bloodthirsty canines), Angelica Huston, Saïd Taghmaoui, Jerome Flynn and a scene-stealing Mark Dacascos and a collection of actions scenes that involve such things (as I kid you not) classic novels, underwater fights, motor cycle chases, shotgun rampages and horse riding through a busy New York street, there aren't many films like John Wick or many that could even dare to be it.Starting out much the same way as the 2nd installment in the franchise, Parabellum begins in breathtaking fashion with its opening 20 - 30 minutes stanza some of the best your likely to see in 2019 and while it's hard for the film to maintain this hyperactive energy over a two hour plus runtime, it's great to see Stahelski and his leading man maintain a relatively consistent pacing throughout that despite some mid-section slow down, ensures that as it turns the corner into its endgame, we won't barely get a moments respite from the action delights coming our way.At the end of the day everything that happens in Parabellum is unbelievable, silly and often outrageous but John Wick embraces this and runs with it, it knows what it is and is proud of it and this beautifully shot, carefully choreographed and often thrilling exercise is the best example of a Hollywood action film your likely to get, with enough gas left in the tank to suggest that a 4th John Wick adventure is a more than an appealing proposition.Final Say -Once more anchored by a great Keanu Reeves turn and elevated by some incredible feats of action ballet, John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is an absolute blast from start to finish that further solidifies John Wick's placing in the very best action film franchises of all time.4 library books out of 5",

In between the seemingly endless shooting scenes there are brief intermissions where characters are talking, but the story that's being created makes about as much sense as Sharknado's. Except the story is not even remotely funny. The story is so confusing, pointless & nonsensical that I suspect the director contracted a handful of stuntmen to write the script on their breaks. This is probably the first movie I've seen that if you reorder the scenes randomly the movie will make exactly as much sense as the original cut does. Disclaimer: we left the movie when a dozen cyborg-looking characters in bullet-proof armor failed to take down the hero they had surrounded, mostly we left out of boredom & puzzlement. So maybe it gets better after that, I'll never know. If you want to watch a better movie I can only recommend one of these:* Quake 2 - Walkthrough - Mission 1 on Youtube\n* Sharknado\n* Plan 9 from outer spaceEach of these was way better than John Wick 3 in every single respect.",

I had a headache after listening to what seemed like 10,000 rounds of ammunition being fired as if someone was sitting next to me in the theater popping them off. John Wick must be the luckiest person in the world to crash through about 15 glass cases without getting a single cut nor require any medical treatment of any kind.

He is about to be declared Excommunicado for killing a member of the High Table, the gangster elite who rule over crime and assassins. Worried more about his dog, he sends it in a taxi to a refuge. John's old friends Winston (Ian McShane) and King of the Bowery (Laurence Fishburne) are also in trouble for assisting him, visited by an Adjudicator (Asia Kate Dillon) they are given notice to quit. Wick's old trainer The Director (Anjelica Huston) is handed a more severe immediate sanction. A new cat-loving assassin, Zero (Mark Dacascos) is sent after Wick. John's old friend Sofia (Halle Berry) aids him and you don't mess with her dogs.Violence, killings, stranglings, shootings, stabbings, dogs going for the groin. A disturbing film, leavened by humour, even someone with six knives stuck in them may seem funny. But the laughter sticks in your throat when Wick slowly forces a knife blade into an opponent's eye - and that is one of the less unpleasant scenes. The suspension of disbelief kicks in perfectly as hordes of henchmen are dispatched by Wick and his associates. The dogs jump like ballet dancers as they they tackle the assassins' tackle. Narrow streets, tunnels and passages provide the perfect battlegrounds for skilfully choreographed fights. With real ballet dancers performing in The Director's Academy, which doubles as an Assassins School. The standout fight scene occurs in a veritable house of mirrors consisting of glass cases. Chad Stahelski directs a witty if disturbing action masterpiece. 9/10.",

It shows how the hunter has become the hunted as professional hitman John Wick gets chased around the globe and must reconcile with allies from the past to save his life. The story gets some more depth towards the end as a web of conspiracies, intrigues and lies unfolds and offers a few minor surprises and twists.The action sequences are even grittier than in the two convincing prequels. The body count in the first fifteen minutes alone is very elevated and will keep the audience on the edge of its seats. The characters don't only use weapons like pistols and daggers but also martial arts techniques inspired buy jiu-jitsu and judo in particular. Other memorable action scenes include a fast-paced escape on a horse, a motorcycle chase and the final scene on a rooftop. Let's also point out that two dogs have some quite remarkable appearances in this film that can be considered highlights of the franchise.The locations are also quite intriguing this time around. Aside of locations familiar from the first two films, we discover a Russian theater linked to John Wick's past, an elegant skyscraper made of glass and the city of Casablanca in Morocco as well as the nearby desert. The combination of stunning action scenes, beautiful locations and a few plot twists keep the film entertaining from start to finish.In the action film genre, the John Wick franchise is the best thing you could watch these days. This is what the Expandables franchise should have become like as Keanu Reeves faces some prolific actors of the action film genre like Marc Dacascos and Yayan Ruhian. If you analyze the fascinating universe the three movies of the franchise have put together, the sum can even be considered greater than its parts. The only reason why this movie doesn't get a higher rating is because it remains very formulaic, predictable and traditional beyond its entertaining values.",

One would be that some of the CGI used for knives and such were too noticeable at times, not exactly wonky but breaks the immersion. The other is on several occasions there's a small delay before either Keanu or an enemy reacts when it's obvious it's their move, especially when multiple enemies around and 1 stands there for a second before attacking/shooting. At one point there's a reload stand-off, and to me it appeared that the enemy actually finished first, so he has to wait for Keanu to load for a split-second before he can get shot. Once again, this isn't game-breaking but there is a certain loss of grace (my eyes, of course, may have deceived me).There most definitely needs to a 4th entry!",

Its a decent idea, assassin who operates outside the code he has sworn to serve. Yet as the third installment demonstrates, often less is more.This film feels like expended potential. Its been overdone and it shows. There's little in the way of a story that moves the Wick universe along. Instead, what you get is, \"stab, shoot, beat\"......repeat. Its alright for the first 15-20 minutes but thereafter it feels like a tiresome dead weight of brutality you simply wish would end.In my view its time this one was put out to pasture and time taken to really think hard about where to go next. 5/10 from me.",

        "text": "While the franchise parted with logic early on, some unjustly blame the third installment for being little more than choreographed shooter game-play. That it was from the get go in 2014. But this third part of the movie series has in fact more to it story-wise than recognized by some. The shots are almost artsy, the fights are not meant to be understood seriously apparently, extra credit though for dogs ripping Arabian testziclez clean off. There is more realism to this world than apparent at first glance. Think of the world of agencies like KGB, CIA, Mossad, or Jacuzzi who indeed cut their fingers, and you will find both the allegory and inspiration for this movie. Murders and assassinations are exaggerated, but it is not like traitors to the mob or equivalent state secret services are not offed, think about the sorry fate of FSB traitor Litvinenko, or any such spy like affair. Even the infrastructure then makes a bit of sense. But, John Wick movies do not strive to make much sense, it is style over substance all over again, and style now borders on art, like ballet, while substance is marginal - mostly a deep state metaphor, but so is James Bond lacking in it, of realism there is almost none, it is pure indulgence but with some actual story, perhaps a bit too complex for consumers and fans of this sort of a movie. So, I do not judge it too harshly, but the whole John Wick series should not be taken too seriously. Think of it as series of MTV spots, game-play intertwined with some allegorical stuff inspired by the underworld of government agencies, mafia organisations or terror networks. Which are close to each other anyway, and this movie is an offshoot of that as a holding place for some gun-fu sword-ballet, overdone Kill-Bill sans the meaningful story part, but with hints of real underworld of greasy spy and mafia \"rules\", with disgusting government agents like that annoyingly disgsuting woke pronoun actress that \"adjudicates\" and cancels with the same subtlety as millennial air-headed twitter mob.",

        "text": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)I don't have a written review for each of the previous films, but I did watch both and thoroughly enjoyed them! John Wick (2014) is one of the best movies of that year and one of the best action films ever. However, John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017) is a bit more convoluted and messy regarding its story and how it brings our protagonist back into the game, but the franchise's outstandingly choreographed fight sequences still make it tremendously entertaining.And it's precisely the mind-blowing, bone-crushing, jaw-dropping, extraordinarily long and brutally choreographed action scenes that make John Wick one of the most badass characters in the history of cinema! The Academy has been looking for something new to make the Oscars more popular, and the creation of new categories has been their number one idea. Well, nothing fits the show better than Best Stunt Work. Obviously, franchises like this one or Mission: Impossible would become major successes at this award show. These two sagas are undeniably the most important and crucial for the survival of truly real action. What you see, it's what you get.Nowadays, viewers already have their eyes set to acknowledge everything as CGI or some sort of visual effect. I'll never forget when I left my Mission: Impossible - Fallout screening and while getting out of the theater, a group of friends was laughing around saying something along the lines of \"of course that scene is fake and this moment is CGI, how can you believe that?! You're such a moron!\" They were roasting one of their friends, thinking he was the dumb one when he was probably the one who was laughing the hardest. This definitely leaves me sad. Sad that people won't realize how incredible movies like these are. How they genuinely work like crazy to provide the audience with real and authentic stunts.Yes, it's over-the-top. Yes, CGI and visual effects are still applied, but just to little details like bullets, blood, falls or knife throwing, which never distract you. And yes, it requires the audience to suspend their knowledge of physics in a few particular moments. But that's the thing: if you're pumped to watch a third film of a franchise, you're a fan. You know what it's about and what's its tone. John Wick established itself in 2014 as a pure revenge story and an unbelievably realistic action movie, the closest we will ever get to an assassin origin tale. John Wick: Chapter Two deeply explored the institution that governs these assassins and all of the rules that they are bound by. It's a bit messier than the first one, but it's still a blast of entertainment.Parabellum has the best of both installments. It has the best-choreographed action ever seen on a big screen and some of the most impressive camera work I've ever witnessed. In addition to this, the narrative makes more sense, and the characters decisions are logically or emotionally justifiable, contrary to the second film. The sound design is powerful, and the cinematography plus the set design look stunning. I would still argue that the pacing could have been better controlled. The transitions between long action sequences and the respective pauses to move the plot forward aren't always smooth. Some comedy bits that I don't think they really belong in this saga were added, and while some work just fine, others really don't fit this world.Besides that, I don't really have much to complain about. The cast is absolutely impeccable. Keanu Reeves is battling with Tom Cruise for the biggest action movie star alive. While Cruise puts his life more in risk by performing especially dangerous stunts, Keanu has the resiliency and agility of a beast, providing us with high-speed and hard-to-do fight sequences. Halle Berry (Sofia) is one hell of a surprise! I had no idea she was (still) capable of moving as she does in this film. The stunts that she performs are crazily good! Laurence Fishburne (Bowery King), Ian McShane (Winston) and Lance Reddick (Charon) also have their own shining moments, but Sofia's dogs are deadly cute, and they steal the show.Regarding the action stunts, they're all pretty memorable. From a throwback to Chapter Two's mirror room to an astonishingly riveting chasing scene through the streets of New York, everything Chad Stahelski and his talented crew throw at the audience is absolutely perfect. I also love how the final act resembles the experience of playing a videogame. You know when you have several levels, each of them with their respective boss, but the final boss is at the top of them all? It's kind of like Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time when Link has to eliminate an enemy in each floor in order to move up to the next one until he reaches Ganondorf. It might be the must nonsensical analogy that I have, but it's what my memory triggered. In the end, there are tons of set pieces for everyone to enjoy.All in all, John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is everything fans of this franchise desired: brutal, bloody, long, loud and beautifully-choreographed fight sequences, accompanied by a decent story that explored even more the assassins' world. Chad Stahelski is a master filmmaker, who knows how an action movie should be filmed. There are no sloppy editing or quick cuts here. Only extensive one-take scenes, filled with outstanding stunt work from a phenomenal cast. Keanu Reeves is one of the most incredible action film stars ever and Halle Berry surprises with her physical abilities. With better control of its pacing and tone (and a bit less defiance of physics), this could have easily been the best action movie of the century. \"One of the best\" it's still one hell of a tagline.",

        "text": "At this point I'm actually convinced that the writer of these movies, Derek Kolstad, is actually a kid who goes in the elementary school and is paying some older bald dude to act as him in public, goes to events, promotions, etc, so people don't figure it out. That's the level of writing we're talking about. Baffling. I really don't understand how can someone completely turn their brain off and enjoy this. This is filled with plot holes, stupid character choices that don't make any sense or they don't even matter, amazingly dumb reveals, connections and people that feel like they threw them in in the last minute and they are not believable at all, empty characters, totally unbelievable back stories, repetitive lines and cliche dialogues. We are talking about even the most banal minor things here, like a bad guy slowly walking in the library, holding a book and quoting it, yet you know, by simple use of logic, that this particular book shouldn't even be there in the first place.Even fighting choreography is not good at all. People with weapons - trained ''professionals'', always run into John Wick, instead of hiding and keeping distance. Filming action in wides is commendable, but that means that you really notice when fighting choreography is not 100% on point, because there are people in the background waiting for their turn to run into John Wick like zombies and die, and it's so obvious, you just have to don't look into John Wick for a second and you'll see it. Fist fights are so boring and dull. When bad guys can easily kill John Wick they never use/have weapons on them. When they can shoot him in the back they decide to sneak on him, or use swords.You can't help it but notice that enemy always comes in 1 by 1, and you know that the next guy will only come when John finishes with the guy he is fighting at the moment. Enemies in video games are more realistic than this. At least there enemies are attacking you at the same time.Villain is insanely weak and boring. They didn't just recycle sets from part 2, they are literally recycling dialogue. It feels like they are shoving some lines down your throat all the time, even back from part 1, and they are really overstaying their welcome with those. I liked incorporation of Halle Berry's dogs, but what's the point of John Wick's dog anymore? He just get tossed around. Someone call the animal shelter already and get this guy a nice warm home, cause John Wick is a terrible dog owner. He doesn't even have a name yet.John Wick's ''real'' identity gets revealed, and i cringed and laughed like a maniac. What were they even thinking there?Again, as i wrote in my review for part 2, world-building is too cartoonish and too much. No one above age of 10 should ever believe for more than 5 minutes what they set-up here. Harry Potter's world is much more believable than this, and this movie wants to be taken seriously. Jesus.... And they do the stupid crowd again. People get massacred in front of bunch of civilians, and not a single person notices. They just walk past and continue with their lives. But maybe, just maybe, Chad Stahelski is onto some social commentary here, and he did it on purpose. -wink wink-Even the CGI is bad at times. Just look at library stab. It looks like something made 15 years ago. There's even a trope that characters are disappearing when some object passes between them. I thought no one is doing that for like, what, 30 years?Here's the thing that annoys me the most, even from part 2. They keep calling John Wick ''The Boogeyman''. No one want to mess with him. He is this legendary assassin. Everyone is scared of him. But yet, every random assassin on the street doesn't think about twice when they hear there's bounty on his head. They just run into him and die. Why are they even thinking they can kill him. Why are they throwing their life away so easy when we are talking about the most bad-ass notorious guy in this world. I understand that there's a huge money on the line, but you know that you are literally throwing your life away for this money that you''ll never going to get. We are not talking about 100m race here, where, for example, i'm professional runner, i know that if i go vs Usain Bolt in his prime, 99,9% percent i'm gonna lose, but it doesn't hurt to try for millions of dollars. This is life and death vs best death dealer in the world. It's just stupid. And i'm overanalyzing this just to make a point of how a 3d character should think, and how a cartoon characters in this movie think.I want to be objective here, and although the movie really pissed me off at times, i can say that: 1. Action scenes are repetitive and stupid, but some of them were unique, enjoyable and fun, with some great stunt work 2. Cinematography is very nice. 3. I liked Laurence Fishburne. And that's it from the positives.",

I noticed it right away with the fight scene in the library at the beginning of the film. Looked as though the Russian guy just stopped fighting back at some point. I was hoping that maybe it was just that one scene but I noticed the problem throughout most of the film. Needed a better story and fewer (but better staged) fight scenes.",

How badass is that? I'll tell you how much: ALL of the badass.Parabellum begins the action almost immediately and doesn't let up. Even when it does slow down, it doesn't feel like it, because it does a deep dive into John's backstory; but since the filmmakers are masters of \"if you can show it, don't say it,\" even exposition & world building flows right along with the full throttle pacing of the rest of the movie.Halle Berry steals the show, 100%. I want a full movie solely about her character, Sophia...no...I want a complete trilogy. She's so incredible in her action scenes, that she makes John's feel almost boring. She's just as good as John Wick, but boiling over with ferocity, and with an added skill that trumps John completely.Asia Kate Dillon's character, The Adjudicator, is a force of nature; a storm that brings death & chaos everywhere they go. While they may not be a fighter, they are an insane villian that'd fit perfectly in a Batman movie.The action itself is filmed with such precision, with long takes, that you feel like you accidentally walked directly into the mayhem.

The original John Wick I liked being a\nstraightforward revenge assassin Action movie that had a perfect balance of story and action sequences without feeling too overwhelming or bloated. The pacing was really good and I was satisfied with how it ended. The same could not be said for John Wick: Chapter Two sadly. The action sequences were still there and well shot, but everything else for me took a back step. The plot got more confusing and bloated, the action sequences were starting to overstay their\nwelcome and get too long, and the pacing was all over the place instead of flowing smoothly like the first one did. I thought it was a big step down overall.So what about John Wick Chapter 3 - Parabellum? Is it an improvement over John Wick 2? Sort of, I guess? I preferred the action in this one to Chapter Two. However, the same issues with Chapter Two remained in John Wick 3. The first 20 minutes I was really hooked into the movie. Some of the very best Action sequences are in there and it made sense with the story and didn't feel like filler. Unfortunately, after that things really slow down and we get loads of lame plot stuff that drags and the introduction of new characters which sucked. The acting was pretty shaky and I found the movie unintentionally funny in places. Well if the Action is amazing then that's all that matters right? John Wick 3 does deliver in that category. The shots and sequences are done really nicely, the music is good, but it started getting too repetitive again with the action like Chapter Two. It really felt like a Video Game in parts, and there was no threat to deal with and it just didn't get me engaged as much as I hope it would.Overall, John Wick 3 to me felt for the most part \"All Style No Substance\". It was too long, they made the action sequences too lengthy once again like Chapter Two, and there was boring plot stuff in-between that was just lame and new characters that sucked for the most part. If you are literally a guy that only wants to see really well shot Action sequences, John Wick 3 will deliver. However, if you want a nicely packaged Action and story movie like the first one though, then you're probably end up not liking it nearly as much similar to me.5/10",

All I can say is, I am most definitely looking forward to the next one if there is one and I truly hope there is! I don't even think I really even need to go into detail here, if you love a good action movie with all the right moves that can still tell a good story then you can't go wrong with these. The acting, directing, and filming are all on point. Even topping out at a little over 2hrs these movies have all managed to keep my A.D.H.D. rear end glued to the edge of my seat from start to finish. Even for those that are not particularly big on action movies should see these at least once. The story line is solid, the emotions are real, and the twists and turns of loyalties and betrayals are enough to keep anyone wanting to see more.",

There are a few ok action scenes but the cgi is one of the worst that i have seen, yet it is gobbled up, it is alike watching satire on action films made one the format of family guy. The story makes no sense and therefore the movie makes in sense, a whole big cliche. For the whole length of the film I thought that the film was made by someone else (directing/ producing/screenwriting) but no its all the same people who have done the semi-realistic and well made art 1 and 2, its just they have given up as they realised the people will gobble everything up. It is sad that people will continue to sponsor this whilst the movies will become worse and worse. It will see the fair of fast and furious and the alike, films that had some idea at the start but after they are milked for profits and made worse and worse. Just don't waste your time and if you want whatch the bond films (which still have some fun stuff to offer and sometimes experiment, and are not so stupid, and in part are made well (like casino royal) or even mission impossible, which although has nothing new to offer the quality of the action and cgi are good and are made as if the director and producer care. Honestly apart from the ok staged fights at the start (which are still way worse than the previous 2 films had) the film has nothing to offer exept for cliches bad cgi, stupidity and a killer cast which stoped caring.",

The deep layers established in the original and built on in the sequel are really explored in greater depth in chapter 3, to good effect. The inclusion of Asia Kate Dillon's Adjudicator was very welcome, partially due to their incredible performance as the stoic judge of the criminal underworld. The story in this film is close to non-existent. Picking up from the end of the second and giving John one goal: survival. The lack of story is welcome, as it doesn't take anything away from the breathtaking action. Some scenes had me scratching my head as to how they could have shot it, and wondering why there was no disclaimer in the credits reading \"No cameramen were harmed in the making of this movie\". While the penultimate fight dragged on a little too long for my liking, the finale was perfectly earned and built up, with fight scene prior to the penultimate one being perhaps my favourite in film history. As always, Keanu brings his A-game, and Lance Reddick as Charon solidifies himself as my favourite character in the franchise bar Wick himself. There is little else to say about John Wick Chapter 3. If you enjoy good acting, gut wrenching, visceral, hyper-violent and wince-worthy action, comedy (surprisingly) and have an appreciation for cinematography in any degree: watch this film. Now.",

We don't really know what his power source is unlike you. So in the third installment we pick up with Wick being marked for deletion with a huge bounty by that mondo organization whose thing is robot-like loyalty.It doesn't take long for the action to begin as it should since this isn't \"On Golden Pond\". And when it begins it just keeps coming. This is playing a bit to lowest common denominator because its the scenes in between where this film really is interesting. The characters of Halle Berry, Ian McShane, Lawrence Fishburne, Lance Reddick, and Angelica Huston make the story rise above the fights which honestly are so plentiful and well staged they kind of get lost after a while. Then there's two special characters that doll out the ominous decisions from which everything kind of springs forth. They are \"the adjudicator\" and \"the elder\". The elder, though interesting is milk toast compared to the imposing adjudicator played by Asia Dillon. You kind of hang on and hope for the up-commence of her character as she imposes the rules and regulations of fealty with evil impunity. This is a good performance.I'm tiring of the fights although I must say it hasn't been done better and the motorcycle scenes are truly over-the -top. It's all a big video game like to a kind of generic middle-ground Sci-Fi/drama thing. Still impressive. But past all of the action it's the character who make John Wick still a thing. In spite of the technical prowess I'm pretty much just in for the characters and the fact Wick seems to be unable to die. We are hit squarely with an ending that promises another installment. I do recommend this but I want more of the character and story in the next one please - because I know I'll get the action as that is a given.",

The fighting skills and gun fight are on point, it was total eye candy to watch, before this film we only had seen gun fighting skills but this film proved everything that JOHN WICK is perfection in every fighting format, the hand combats in this film reminded me of RAID REDEMPTION which actually i think this film had delivered equal choreography in hand to hand fight sequences.Now halley berry was suprisingly great, she is a real badass where she actually trained for it, kudos to her, new casting for opponents were also quite impressive Both actors had very quite great impact against John Wick thats another reason why this movie was great. Overall I can watch it again n again in future.Now the man himself KEANU REEVES, his intense n bold body language was perfect for character, just from couple of dialogue deliveries in his mysterious voice was enough for the character to last an impression. He is a great performer too n had trained hard for the fight sequences to make it look real.",

        "text": "The John Wick series reaches its third chapter more exaggerated, visceral and imposing than ever. \"Parabellum\" means 'prepare for war', and that is exactly what happens here. Keanu Reeves returns to the skin of the murderer who comes out of retirement to once again encounter a bloodbath - especially after the conclusion of the second chapter, when he kills the antagonist Santino D'Antonio (Riccardo Scamarcio) inside the Continental Hotel, territory prohibited to the High Summit. Set in this extreme attitude, John Wick 3: Parabellum soon starts with the rush for a countdown; either because of his life that is on a string or because of his long-lasting alliance with the underworld, which has been drastically reduced in a matter of minutes. Our protagonist is now being chased by members of the High Summit under the $ 14 million reward. Now, he needs to join forces with former partners who have helped him in the past while fighting for his survival.Chad Stahelski again in the direction, does not hesitate to magnify the dose of the spectacle in chivalrous levels, especially the already expected sequences of action and hand-to-hand struggles, but he also seeks to measure all the violence with a narrative thread that is sewn between these moments. However, no matter how impactful the combat scenes are, they are in greater number and this ends up weakening the plot, especially in the final act - even with new characters and included bows, which give fresh air to the John Wick universe. Once again it is the action that dictates the narrative and not the other way around. There is also a lot of care in the composition of the biggest combat scenes (see Casablanca with Halle Berry and his two dogs) elevating Parabellum to a level as fun as it is surprising. The fluidity of the assembly in these more frantic passages is very well done and, with the strong presence of Keanu Reeves along with the great choreography, no matter which tool he uses: be it knives, books, horses, motorcycles or dogs, they will all be accurate companies in each conflict. Parabellum always seeks to cross new lines as to what Wick may be capable of when it comes to enduring pain and slaughtering his enemies.Speaking of the script, again written by Derek Kolstad, who this time wins the company of Shay Hatten, Chris Collins and Marc Abrams, the dialogue choices are sometimes confusing, sometimes funny: little easter eggs go back to the first film (where it all started with cause of a dog and a car - watch the trilogy, you will understand) and please those who know the saga of the fugitive killer better. However, even for the most veteran, some dialogues and introductions of characters are confusing, exercising only the function of \"filling in the script\". Acquaintances of John Wick's past come and go, suffer consequences for his actions and, those who survive, disappear from the film as if they had never participated. However, the story became richer and more interesting. You want to know more about how the organization works: what the rules are, who the new characters are, and find out about John Wick's past. The expansion of the character's universe surprises positively, although it reveals little.\nIn fact, the action scenes have never been so inspired by the franchise, and look, we had already seen spectacular things in previous films. Each of the scenes is unique, original, which are exquisitely incorporated into this world of the franchise. The first half hour is frantic and we already see a phenomenal hand-to-hand fight in the library; an improvised cold-blood surgery that was completed by the patient himself; a spectacular sequence in an antiques store that culminates in a knife fight of impressive realism inspired by Asian cinema, bringing ninjas into their shadows - one of the best fighting sequences in action films; we also have battles with katanas on bikes and many fights involving martial arts. Western fans, in addition to vibrating with the knife scenes in an antique store, will also be excited about the flight on a horse (after a fight in a stable). Still, later, we have the fights in Morocco involving the character Sofia and her two dogs in another exciting passage; a new chase with motorcycles through the streets of New York, in addition to the final act at the Continental hotel. However, it is precisely in this third act, that the struggles become too repetitive and tiring. With some mistakes in the execution of the most evident choreographies - someone already waiting for the fictional blow to then jump or retaliate, for example. Often, the impact of the fights is reduced, and you just wait for the end of one more sequence so that the film, in short, continues. The film, which stretches over two hours at a vigorous pace, sometimes without much inspiration, which ends up making the immersion slightly shallower with each fight introduced, however much it makes sense. The feeling is that the film could have been at least twenty minutes less.'John Wick 3: Parabellum' is a work that stands out for its visuals, but its beauty is not limited to that. There is a very evident care with photography, both in the color palette, always emphasizing more contrasting and strong tones, and in the way everything is carefully shown, without sudden movements and excessive cuts - on the contrary, what we see is a captivating preciousness for long shots. The neo-noir style prevails in this 3rd chapter, stronger than ever. The vivid colors and the very different scenarios, allied to the way the streak sequences are conducted, give a video game style as the plot progresses, as if Wick was going through different phases. Each of the set pieces, that is, scenes located in a specific location, are like phases whose difficulty is accentuated. The number of opponents increases, as does the number of tools to kill them. In a way, this is what drives the plot: he needs to join forces with people who have helped him in the past, including Sofia (Halle Berry) and the Director (Anjelica Huston), key pieces that help him open doors for their redemption before the High Summit, even though they know that they may be harmed in the face of their opponents. The introduction of these characters brings very significant elements (such as the setting in Casablanca and a dance school in New York), but the lack of background for Sofia's stories and the Director is very present, making it clear that they were inserted to be developed in possible future films in the franchise.More than a simple sequence, this feature serves to definitively establish a franchise. The goal here is to build connections, present hierarchies, anticipate conflicts and establish mythology, not just of the title character, but of others - whether they are old acquaintances or not. It considerably expands the universe that surrounds the High Summit (especially Asia Kate Dillon) and the most diverse killers who work around the world, but is more concerned with the urgency of situations than necessarily explaining how certain characters arrived at what is ours presented in this chapter. The common thread is the fact that Wick is the most wanted killer around the world, and it is through this situation that everything unfolds. The tones of the story, despite being a bit exaggerated in certain moments, do not sound megalomaniacal: as the script gives up the space that could be the obvious to dive into the most insane struggles, there is balance and the ease in entering faithfully in this scene full of blood, but also of loyalty.With his head at a premium, John Wick has to use everything he has to stay alive. We still don't know everything about him, but the certainty grows that he is a kind of Superman without superpowers, a Jack Bauer who spends more than just 24 hours suffering, a homelier and urban Ethan Hunt without twists or a James Bond without gadgets. - and that you should not touch the dog or his car. Despite this, we are talking about a feature-length film that, surprisingly, has its feet on the ground. Do not wait for the amazing explosions that occur with a single direct hit and that kill 58 opponents simultaneously. Leave it to Mercenaries, for example. In Parabellum, as crazy as the confrontations are, they are relatively credible. This production has a greater function within what John Wick has become (and within what must still become) is reflected in a dialogue of the film itself, when the protagonist is asked about going through a journey to end how he started. Perhaps for this reason this sequence is the most loaded with fight scenes, in the most diverse scenarios and with the most different and creative variations. Small corridors are placed, not to suggest a difficulty, but to reinforce the narrative that John Wick is good at what he does. Although the battle that precedes the final fight sounds forced and has no role in the work, it can be ignored without affecting the feature in any way, all the action sequences are a separate show.Parabellum leaves many loose ends for future sequels. With a hook created without the immediacy of what was used to link the previous feature to this one, John Wick's sequences should begin to seek an increasingly intense and expressive grandeur. It is difficult to know where the future will take, but as long as it knows how to recognize itself as a genre film, respect its limitations and invest in its qualities, there are no possible limits for Chad Stahelski and his work. There will be plenty of opportunities for even more challenging action scenes. But that they also come in the right dose. And how are they going to create sequences to overcome the use of a pencil as a weapon, flying knives, a hero on horseback against ninja bikers in the middle of the city? There is no doubt that if they keep the same team ahead of the franchise, we will have an even better sequel.",

        "text": "When the first John Wick (2014) came out, I thought it was just another action movie and paid it no attention. After a friend finally convinced me to see it, I was in awe of the \"gun-fu\" action sequences. Having a steady camera with amazing choreography made this series stand out enough that I saw the sequel in theaters. Unfortunately, I wasn't as impressed with Chapter 2 (2017), as it leaned heavily on developing the lore of The Continental. To add insult to injury, it also fell into the Trilogy Conundrum: a fantastic standalone movie with a sequel that requires the third installment to wrap up the plot (e.g., The Matrix (1999)).While I praise the simplicity of the first movie in this series, things have gotten ridiculous by Chapter 3 (2021). Yes, there are still some action sequences that maintain some of that excellent choreography. However, there were too many fight scenes with some gimmick that merely made me roll my eyes. Whether it was a fight on a horse against motorcycles, a fight with a pack of dogs, or a swordfight in a glass maze, I longed for fights that were more...stationary.Additionally, Chapter 3 also ended in such a way that demands a fourth entry in the series. At this point, I'm more confused about what The Continental is, who runs it, and what rival factions are out there than when I started this series. Sure, a guy getting revenge for someone killing his dog is silly in hindsight, but at least it wasn't endlessly complicated. I can only hope that Chapter 4 (2022) finally answers some questions because Chapter 3 did a poor job of tying up any loose ends.A series devolving into ridiculous action set pieces, I give John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum 3.0 stars out of 5.",

The plot was paper thin and just an excuse to glorify killing.

The scene is so kinetic that raise your adrenaline level and keep you holding your breath (quit difficult thing because on top of the ultra violence, the scene became darkly funny and force you to laugh). This is just one scene of the many action pieces this movie has. It is not the most spectacular but is going to blow your mind and body. Do not expect to find anything remotely close on a Marvel/Disney movie. This is really excellent action, play by real actors not the boring and (really bad) digital fights on the Avengers movies.\nAs much action and violence this movie has (which is more than all this year's movies combined) the script department was a bit disappointing. I was really expecting a little more development. I am glad anyway they leave it open for Chapters 4; but I comes faster than Chapter 3.\nIn terms of acting; Keanu, Ian McShane,Lance Reddick, Fishburne deliver their characters with great charisma and wit. Halle Berry is always excellent as an action star and I hope her character comes back. Marc Dacascos still has the moves but deserves a better written character. But the stunts and doubles are the best ; they really deserve Oscars even when their faces are rarely shown.\nIn brief; minimu story (which basically was the norm this year with most of the blockbusters), but extremely well crafted cinematography and action scenes with a bit of fun.",

        "text": "It should go without saying that the John Wick movies were never intended to be award-winning films by any stretch of the imagination. Sometimes a film can spawn sequels due to fan appreciation and then build a world off the things that audiences grew to love, which in this case, was heavy violence. I'm almost baffled that movies like this are still being made in today's climate, but to be able to look past our daily lives and invest ourselves in fictional stories will hopefully always be around, no matter what the subject matter may be. At times too violent, even by the standards set by the previous two instalments, here's why I believe John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is a great action film, but not quite a great movie as a whole.After making a few bad calls in the previous film, this third instalment follows John Wick once again, as he now has a 14 million dollar bounty on his head, and everyone wants to take him out. That's the basic premise here, but as all of these movies have tended to do, the story gets a little muddled and tries to build out this world a little too much. Let's not kid ourselves though, if you're someone who hopes for an incredible piece of storytelling in a movie like this, you're going to be incredibly disappointed. These films are made for the incredible action and this one definitely doesn't shy away from that.Although this instalment does feel its slightly long runtime of 130 minutes, this film also features the biggest headcount, which was almost jarring at times. Even for action junkies who loved the violence in the first two films, it has been cranked up much more this time around, if that's even imaginable. From stabbing to shooting to crazy choreography, John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is a no-holds-bar thrill ride from beginning to end. If you find yourself slightly bored by a few story elements throughout the second act of the film, don't worry, because you'll be given more than enough action to make up for that, which also leads me to my biggest complaint with this movie.First and foremost, this movie focusses on being an action film and never once does it stray from that goal. For that reason alone, action fans are going to get their fix here. It's not, however, all that interesting when it comes to world-building. There is a significant portion of this film that introduces new characters and other organizations, which could make for some great standalone stories, but just felt like a bit much to be included in this film. There were moments where I felt the movie dragging because it slowed down immediately after a 10-minute action scene.Overall, John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is a very solid sequel to the first two films and is pretty much on par with the quality of the franchise in general. This is a consistently entertaining series that I will continue to recommend to those who like a lot of violence in movies. If you're someone who can't take a violent death scene, then I would advise staying away from this franchise, with an emphasis on this film in particular. John Wick: Chapter 3: Parabellum definitely has issues, but I thoroughly enjoyed watching it.",

        "text": "John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is the third entry in the John Wick action thriller series. Once again directed by Chad Stahelski and starring Keanu Reeves in the lead role, it is a solid continuation of the title character's story while adding even more to the world building element set up previously.Immediately after the events of John Wick: Chapter 2, former assassin John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is on the run after killing a member of the High Table at The Continental hotel in Manhattan. With a $14 million bounty now on his head, Wick must find find a way to safely escape New York City, while avoiding death by other assassins from all parts of the world.As reliably action-packed as it is great to look at, John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is so far the best installment of this ever growing franchise which serves to remind us that Keanu Reeves is deserving of his place back in the spotlight. Wick is still the \"one man army\" force to be reckoned with, and Reeves again adds that trademark nuance to his performance to help things along nicely. However, the film also introduces Halle Berry's character Sofia as a helpful accomplice of Wick, showing that she too may also have potential for an action star comeback. It's a shame she does not feature in the story as much as she should but there is hope she will return in the near future. Like its predecessors, the fight scenes are beautifully shot, owing to director Chad Stahelski's creative use of lighting and cinematography, giving them a noir-like vibe. In addition to this, the film also has some surprisingly funny moments of dark comic relief, which certainly helps ease the tension after some graphic violence. Even though the film does take the predictable route of sequel-baiting, I am definitely on board for any future follow-ups we may having coming our way.I rate it 8/10",

        "text": "Greetings again from the darkness. Worlds are colliding! No, no ... not in the way of \"The Avengers\" movies, but it's kind of hard not to smile when Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne share a scene (or two) in a mini-reunion of THE MATRIX. Mr. Reeves and director Chad Stahelski are back for a third time, and somehow they manage to raise the bar yet again on the fight sequences. And let's face it, the fighting and action are why so many are drawn to this franchise. This latest entry runs 2 hours and 10 minutes, and almost every bit is a frantic chase scene or violent fight ... or both.The film picks up mere moments after JOHN WICK: CHAPTER 2 ended. If you recall, John had killed a member of the High Table inside the Continental Hotel, an unforgivable break in the treasured rules. Winston (Ian McShane), the manager of the hotel, has given his friend a one hour head start prior to issuing the \"excommunicado\". It's that order (and the $14 million bounty) that sends every assassin on the planet on Wick's trail.No need to wait for the good stuff ... the film's first two fight sequences are extraordinary feats of stunt coordination, and consume the first 15-20 minutes. Here is what John Wick (and we viewers) are in for: Guns (many kinds), lots of knives, a hatchet, swords, a book, enough broken glass to fill a recycle center, horses, motorcycles, cars, every martial art known to man, highly trained dogs, a public library, a museum/collectibles display, a stable, and a ballet theatre complete with dancers. There is even a current NBA player, 7'3\" Boban Marjonovic, who battles John Wick and ultimately learns books can be used for something other than reading.John Wick's background is revealed, and his general level of tiredness reaches exhaustion, which actually adds an element to a character who is quite efficient with his conversation. There are a few people who are called on to help Wick, in particular we have Laurence Fishburne as the Bowery King, Anjelica Huston as the Ballet Director, and Halle Berry as Sophia, a former assassin who now runs the Continental Hotel in Morocco. See, even an underworld crime syndicate promotes from within. The segment with Sophia is one of the most fun, and it's not because of Ms. Berry. Rather her beautiful and highly-trained dogs are scene stealers who are devastating in their commitment to carry out orders.Other characters of interest include Asia Kate Dillon (\"Billions\") as the Adjudicator, one who enjoys doling out punishment; Mark Dacascos (Wo Fat in \"Hawaii 5-0) as Zero, the ultimate Wick fanboy who wants nothing more than to be the one who kills him; Jerome Flynn (\"Game of Thrones\") as Berrada, the senior official who doesn't negotiate fairly; Said Taghmaoui as The Elder from the High Table, who listens to Wick's proposal. Other supporting roles are filled admirably by Robin Lord Taylor, Jason Mantzoukas and Susan Blommaert. Of course, some of the most fun occurs again at The Continental Hotel as Reeves' Wick interacts with Lance Reddick and Ian McShane.From the department of \"Give 'em what they want\", the film has a very similar look, feel and tone to the first two, but director Stahelski (a standout stunt coordinator) and writers Derek Kolstad, Shay Hatten, Chris Collins, and Mark Abrams keep it fresh with new characters, new props and some terrific set design. The early model computers are contrasted with the high tech gadgetry of the Continental, and with a body count likely higher than the first two films combined, this entry can best be described as brutally entertaining ... is that even a thing? The violence is vivid and excessive and non-stop, and if that's not your style, you should at least know that the title is taken from the Latin \"Si vis pacem, para bellum\" - If you want peace, prepare for war.",

        "text": "I didn't expect an original story, given this is a direct continuation to where Chapter 2 ended; but all I asked for, besides the brilliant, over-the-top action sequences, is an interesting story that can keep me immersed throughout the entire film. Parabellum doesn't even have a plot of its own: it's completely reliant on its predecessor. This really didn't bother me at all, at first.The way this one picks up only moments from where Chapter 2 ended is just unbelievably great. I really couldn't have hoped, or imagined, for anything better. We get to be fully immersed into the fictional, and almost dystopian, crime world in a way that reminded me somehow of Blade Runner.The action sequences are stylish, insanely brilliantly choreographed and, most importantly, have innovative ideas and execution. John Wick franchise no longer sets the bar high for other action films; it sets up new standards for how action sequences should be shot and choreographed.Story-wise, though, this installment really disappointed me. As I mentioned above, all I asked for is an interesting story, be it a mere continuation of the last film or not. Unfortunately, the story here lacks everything that can make it intriguing. It's simply continuation to Chapter 2's with a rehash of storylines we saw thousand times in other action films to fill in the gaps. Moreover, Halle Berry's Sofia is almost an unnecessary addition to the film. I said almost because her dogs partly redeemed the presence of such useless, and even problematic, character.Drama is definitely not what I expected to see; but with all the silliness in the original and its first sequel, I was somehow, unlike here, emotionally invested in the goings-on and concerned, somehow, about the protagonist. That said, Keanu Reeves is absolutely fantastic as ever. He never gives us let us think of his John Wick as the formidable and invincible hero, even if we are one hundred percent sure he would win at the end of the day.All in all, John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is a decent sequel that proves another excellent entry in the franchise, by further expanding upon this exceptional universe and taking even more risks regarding the action scenes and fight choreography.(8/10)",

Because this is what usually happens with sequel movies:\nThe production companies doesn't want to risk their money. So when they do a big budget film with a famous star, they usually use everything they have in the original first movie: the plot is written at its best, the action is made its best and there is the energy of making a new movie. So they don't plan and write the story to make sequels. And if the movie somehow is loved and liked, and the production companies make good money out of it, then they write the plot of the sequels.And so, it becomes a repetition.And usually, they have to betray (at least some) the story of the first movie in order to make a sequel, which makes it worse.And the crew (director, actors and else) just continues because of money, not because there is some interesting story to tell... that is why you can see the obvious mistakes and other stupid things in the movie, such as: one of the two dogs were shot, but in a later seen we see two dogs biting people.(By the way, the illuminati's, sorry \"high table's highest man living in the middle of a desert was such a nonsense idea)From the movies I have watched, Nolan's Batman trilogy was the only exceptional for a good trilogy.

        "text": "We love blockbusters, the big superhero movies, the mind-bending science fiction adventures. While these films have become very safe picks on where to spend your $10-15 at the theatre, it does feel like the potential for sleeper hits aren't there anymore. John Wick is the exception to this line of thinking, no one saw the huge success these movies would enjoy ahead of time but they put out a quality product, and people showed up. The primary reason for this is the phenomenal action that the franchise displays. Parabellum is no exception, the action scenes aren't just well put together, they're wildly creative. They vary and experiment and most importantly, they work every single time. There were moments in this movie where my jaw dropped (my favourites being the fight in the weapons shop and the battle to get out of the desert compound) and it always felt like as soon as I would get comfortable, the stunt team would pull something new out of their pocket. I can't go on enough about how thrilling and fun those scenes were and just for those parts, this movie is worth catching in the theatre.This franchise has never been about Shakespearean style drama, John has always had a clear motivation and enough to plot to explain why he needs to be out taking care of his fellow assassins. Parabellum also follows this way to tell the story, John Wick 2 ends with John Wick vs the World and we're given enough backstory to shape this idea and then they go with it. Am I making excuses for this movie? Yes and no. I think a deeper story would detract from the movie but maybe they could do a little more with the next one.Keeanu Reeves has never been the most \"expressive\" or \"animated\" actor, he's more know for being stoic but the commitment he shows for this character and this franchise shine through in Parabellum. He's well cast in this role, John is a fairly quiet guy who is still grieving for his wife and he prefers to let his actions do the talking. Reeves has screen presence and its a credit to Staheleski and his team for knowing how to use it. More screen time is dedicated to Ian McShane and Lance Reddick as Winston and Charon, the more famous members of the staff of the Continental hotel. McShane is always fun to watch and it was cool to see Reddick get a little more to do. Halle Berry is effective in her scenes, she's throwing her all into this and it improves the product, hopefully she's back in the further adventures of John Wick. I thought Asia Kate Dillon was great as the Adjudicator, I had no idea who she was but she handled a very steely role and made it memorable. Mark Dacascos is a change of pace as an antagonist for John and his different take is a welcome change. I also really liked Jason Mantzoukas, Laurence Fishburne and Anjelica Houston in their respective supporting roles.Parabellum moves at a pretty quick clip when it comes to the action but there were a couple of times in the movie where the pacing begins to slack. The ending fight scene doesn't disappoint but it feels long and like it could have been edited down a little. There is also some buildup for the reveal of a new character and when that scene finally plays out, it was pretty predictable. It wasn't the fault of the actors, it just felt a little anti-climactic and predictable.The John Wick franchise has quietly become one of the more impressive and consistent series out there. It doesn't just coast, it delivers and ramps things up with each new entry. The action is phenomenal, the choreography is unique, the set pieces are inventive and while they don't feature intricate stories, the acting and the charisma of the performers carries it through. Parabellum grades out at about the same spot as the last John Wick movie as a 9/10. If you love action movies, this is required viewing.Chapter 3 Builds Even More Momentum for the Stellar Franchise",

It literally defined \"action\".So jumping into this I had some expectations and this delivered. When I watch a John Wick film I want to see a fast paced action films with a lot of guns, fighting and car chases. And this third instalment is just that.\nWith sequels I always have a worry that the director tries going bigger and better and yes, definitely there is a lot more going on in this film, better camera shots, more guns and special effects, but it works well with the character and doesn't feel over done at all.This film is basically what it says on the tin. It's jam packed with action. I'll assume that if you are debating this film then you've seen the other 2. And if that's the case then this film is definitely worthy of the John Wick name.My only real criticism of this film is that I thought the ending was a bit dragged out. The final few fighting sequences seemed to go on much longer than they should.But overall it's well worth watching. I mean what more do you want with an action film? Sometimes you need to just sit back and watch some mindless action film with a simple plot filled with explosions, guns, fighting and stunts.",

        "text": "Like every John Wick film I went in wanting to love it, but a lot of things stacked up that made this a very boring, consequence free, pointless experience.Lets talk about the pros first; The action is directed fine (a little static and flat for my tastes, but it's much better than quick cutting garbage), I liked Lawrence Fishburn, Asia Dillon, and Ian McShane, the stuntwork was really good, the cinematography was lovely, and John Wick's origins are hinted at (in an exposition heavy scene, but it was interesting enough).Now the cons: John Wick himself isn't a good character, he seems to be an indestructible killing machine until the last 5 minutes of the film where they need to hook you in for the sequel.I mentioned the action being directed ok, but when you have an indestructible character (with a bullet proof suit on) it makes all the action scenes extremely tedious. I just watch John kill wave after wave of faceless henchman waiting for it to be over and get back to what little character stuff there is. Also the action scenes go on for way too long, I remember yawning or checking my watch a few minutes into every action sequence. There are some shockingly bad effects in these action sequences, specifically three: 1. The scene in Casablanca where Hallie Berry is taking cover behind a pillar, bullets are chipping at her cover and the chipping effect looks so fake. 2. Any time a knife is stabbed into someone it's clearly faked with CGI, this was very distracting due to the amounts of knife attacks in this movie. 3. CGI BLOOD. I hate it when films use CGI blood and this is no exception. It's not gratuitous with it, but it still looks phoney as hell and took me out of the movie.The acting is pretty mixed; Keanu has never been a great actor and he has very little to work with. Hallie Berry is pretty lackluster and phones in her acting (she's only in the movie for 5 minutes). Ian McShane is passable. The only actor I connected with and believed was Lawrence Fishburn as the Homeless king, he really knows how to chew the scenery. Asia Dillon was a neat new character and she was fun to watch exchange banter with Ian McShane.Like I said I wanted to love it, but I can't igore all these glaring issues. I'm happy for you if you liked these, It just doesn't have the same effect on me.",

May it be on horseback, by foot, on a motorcycle or via the aid of trained dogs or the force of literature, the former assassin shows both his mercilessness and vulnerability in all its layers. Sadly, the film lacks the fresh ideas that made the former films so innovative for the genre and ends up as a repetitive rehash with a shallow story, too many plot holes, as well as a painfully lengthy and fatiguing final act that isn't only uninspired in its choreographies, but also the peak of unrealistic character decisions and absurdity. Whatever made me love it back when I watched it in cinema has gone in the same manner as the power that has driven the first two films of that franchise. Hopefully, the next entry, teased at the end, will saddle up again, escape from mediocrity and end this in a proper way that makes the original film justice.",

It has all the action that a movie needs and the and the director made such an incredible job in this movie with sights i've never thought i would see. John Wick chapter 3: Parabellum exceeded my expectations.",

        "text": "Parabellum is an absolutely outstanding and genre-refining film. It's been a long while since we had seen any movies that redefined the action genre up till Mission Impossible: Fallout. Not to say that this is better than that, but this definitely did what no other action movie could since then. It's films like Parabellum that make me love action, the kind of movies that I think about when I hear action. Keanu Reeves has absolutely killed it with this role. He is insanely good with action and he just seems to never get too old for it. Halle Berry is incredibly good, and was very good in all her action scenes too. The action in this movie is by far the best part. It looks extremely realistic, and is brutal, fun and ruthless in every single way. Cerep Arif Rahman and Yayan Ruhian are back again, and they make some very lovable scenes for Indonesian audiences, back with the jokes and incredible stunt acting. The theater was gasping in the first big fight, shocked and slowly realizing what they had actually came in to watch. It is extremely well choreographed with everything being realistic. When there's action, you know what's going on, and you are locked in to whatever's happening. The story is excellent, and just makes so much sense as an excuse for tons of action. The title \"Parabellum\" suits this film very well. This world is out for John Wick, as all his comrades learn to pay for their mistakes. The whole world turns on him, and this is a plot that's just executed extremely well. The issue with this movie, is that there's a lot going on, and it leads to a small bit of pacing issues. The movie can feel a little bit lost at times until you see what happens after the certain scene. There's also a little bit of bad voice acting in a scene, but other than that, not much to complain about. The action shows that the genre can be varied masterfully. We don't need magic, superheros or bombs to have a good time at the movie theater. Parabellum is a replenishing, fun and insanely entertaining movie overall. It stands strong as the best John Wick movie so far. This movie is totally worth a watch. If you don't like gore, this is likely not for you. For anyone who has seen the previous films and loved them, this is definitely for you and it's the kind of action the film industry has missed for 2 years. You also do not need to see the other ones to understand this, but I suggest just knowing the basic plot of the first 2 films.",

The more we learn about this assassin underground, the more preposterously complex it grows. And yet, there's always thought put into things, to the point where even the grandest absurdities have their own kind of logic. It makes for a highly enjoyable world that we want to spend more time in, and learn more about. That's the true brilliance of this franchise. To just have John killing off people, with no real meaning, would get old fast. But by constantly expanding this heightened reality, we can't help but get drawn deeper and deeper into this Wonderland, tumbling down a rabbit hole, waiting to see where it all goes. By the time John Wick: Chapter 3 ends, you'll be almost as exhausted as John Wick himself. And just like him, you'll be ready to come back for more.",

In chapter 3, much like Neo in the Matrix (which Parabellum stole not one, but two quotes from) John Wick now feels invincible. I felt no concern for Wick at any moment. This movie also felt the most derivative, quoting The Matrix, casting two bad guys from The Raid, including yakuza traditions like a Kitano movie, using a book to beat up a bad guy like Bourne Ultimatum, and once again, ending in some sort of Enter The Dragon hall of mirrors style room. The humour didn't land and the samurai bad guy was silly. The main problem, as others have mentioned, is it's too much like a video game, with characters rushing back to the ammo depot to level-up guns and take on increasingly hard bad guys with stronger armour, requiring head shots.For me, one of the most ridiculous elements, was how many assassins there are and how everyone knows Wick's name. It's like the ultimate drinking game to take a shot everytime someone says \"John Wick\", and the amount of times Reeves walks down a street and some beggar, busker, shopkeeper and god knows who else is secretly an assassin or knows who Wick is, was just got ludicrous.I also felt the fight choreography has got repetitive. Unlike the first movie where sequences had strong purpose, chapter 3 feels like a series of levels of Wick fighting the same dudes with the same moves - including the never-ending grab by wrist, kick knee and judo throw. Don't get me wrong, there was still some stunning martial arts, gunplay and fight choreography, but it just felt relentless in a tedious way.I really wanted this to be as awesome as chapters 1 and 2. Sadly it wasn't. It's still leagues ahead of some of the action movies being made today, but I just had such high hopes for this one. It looked just as good, it just seriously lacked a decent plot.",

        "text": "This is the definition of an action film in all of its glory!! I am amazed that this \"franchise\" has done it again with another good entry, only this time the action was turned up to 100. If you thought that the other two \"John Wick\" films had great action, this one blows them out of the water and puts them to shame. Some parts of this film are truly insane.......However as a mentioned in the title this film is more than just action set piece after another, there is an interesting continuation of the story.The first piece of praise has to go to Chad Stahelski who has directed the living heck out of this film, in some ways I cannot believe to imagine the headache and joy this film must have been for him. The amount of detail that has gone into this film is something that shouldn't go unnoticed just because it an action film. Even though the film is very action heavy Stahelski has managed to still careful weave an interesting story throughout that definitely keeps you guessing. He has created the perfect blend of the familiar whilst also introducing new things into the series. Absolutely fantastic from his side of things.The cast all round is fantastic and might be the most solid one out of all three films thus far. The biggest shoutout obviously goes to Keanu Reeves who once again just kicks ass in this film whilst still managing to show us this very complex and damaged character. I have heard that Reeves tries to do as much of the stunt work as possible.....i could be misinformed.......I hope this is true. In certain moments I believe it is because you see his face........yeah I know they could CG his face but.........I will give him the benefit of the doubt. All in all he is fantastic once again.\nOther shoutouts should be for Halle Berry, Ian McShane, Laurence Fishburne and Lance Reddick who are all great either new or returning characters.Now the biggest positive of this film is the fight/stunt choreography. To put it mildly it is jaw droppingly brilliant, I don't think I know enough words in the English dictionary to describe it. It was pure action brilliance on display......this is why the Oscars needs a stunt category. The level set by the previous two films has been completely destroyed and new level has been set not only for this film but action films in general. Every single action set piece is unique whether it be featuring a different location, weapon or personnel all of them show the versatility of action and they seamlessly fit into the film. To be perfectly honest I was shocked at the level of gore as well in this film which was definitely not as prevalent in the other two films. Mind-blowing!!!Lastly the villain was actually quite good in this one, not like the last entry which wasn't great. It is someone you can completely understand there motivations and intentions as to why they are doing things, its a good performance from Asia Kate Dillion.Overall this film is good, its so close to very good unfortunately there are a couple of minor things that didn't work for me. Its just certain character decisions and a scene involving a roof, I won't spoil it, you know what I mean. 75% out of 100 or 7.5 out of 10, I've only given it this score because thats the same score I gave the other two films. I'd say this one is better than Chapter 2 but not quite as good as the first, from a story and emotional standpoint.Saying all of that you will not be disappointed walking out of this pure action blockbuster entertainment from start to finish.",

Check.\nOne-dimensional characters with clear motives? Done.\nAction? Check.\nMore action. Check.\nA love interest who gets only enough screen time to humanise our unstoppable. revenge/justice seeking, death machine? Check.\nAnything else? More action.\nIf the above list doesn't appeal -- Then don't watch John Wick. There are plenty of other films out there.\nIf you want depth, character development and story-telling then read a good book, it's a better medium for it and they bog down the pace of a good action film where pacing is more important than depth, choreography is more important than character development and the story is only used to get the hero from one set-piece to the next.\nParabellum is a relentless, switch-off your brain and have fun film. It's ridiculous in the best ways, loud and violent from start to finish and I enjoyed it immensely.\nIf you haven't seen the first two, I'd recommend catching up before watching the newest instalment but I'm fairly confident newcomers to the series will pick up what's going on, or they won't, I don't think it's integral to revel in the majesty that is John Wick.\nIf you've ever watched 'Commando' or 'The Running Man' and thought to yourself 'They don't make films like that anymore', I can assure you...\nThey do.",

This movie might just be Keanu's best since the first Matrix film and the action in it might be even better (the film even makes reference to the first Matrix in one scene.)Everything about this film was visually satisfying and will probably turn out to be in the top 3 action films of the year. Definitely owe it to yourself to watch Parabellum if you're a fan of Keanu Reeves and love great action movies. It is my favourite of the trilogy. It was truly spectacular",

        "text": "John Wick is back, and the third film in the franchise combines impressive action and world-building to create a unique blend of neo-noir thrills that fans of this series will probably really enjoy. \"John Wick: Chapter 3--Parabellum\" is not without its imperfections, but the film has much to like about it. The film picks up pretty much just after where the second film left off, as Wick is about to be designated \"excommunicado\" with a $14 million bounty on his head for killing someone in a Continental Hotel near the end of the second film, which is strictly prohibited if blood is spilled in the hotel. This film contains incredibly impressive and visceral action scenes that incorporate all types of action techniques, from bare-knuckle fights to gun-fu to motorcycle chasing and more. The action is so intense that you will leave the theater a bit exhausted (in a good way,) and the last time I felt that way after watching a movie was back when I saw \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" in theaters four years ago. Thankfully, the film's trailers don't spoil much of the best action that the film has to offer. The sheer stylization and choreography of all the action is truly astonishing, as is the film's inspirations that manage to span the globe--which include traditional Russian ballet all the way to \"The Raid\"-style fight sequences from Indonesian cinema.Also impressive in the film is the sense of world-building present, as the mythology of what it's like to be an assassin in the \"John Wick\" universe is fleshed out here in far more detail. The scenes set inside the Continental are stunningly shot and lit, and helps provide context surrounding the action that we see. Occasionally, the film's narrative can almost be too reliant on its action sequences. This is not a huge burden on the film given just how impressive the action is, but it still does work to the actual plot line's detriment in some way. The other criticism I have of the film is that it could have used dialogue to further develop the characters and plot more. While the \"John Wick\" films have always been known for primarily focusing on action over dialogue, the writing that exists in the film is often somewhat redundant in nature when you consider that key plot details spoken in the film's dialogue are often clearly conveyed during one of the many action scenes. That said, those who enjoy this franchise will certainly get a genuine thrill out of watching this film on the big screen. 7.5/10",

        "text": "I'm old enough to remember when it was cool and knowing to slag off Keanu. 'He's going to play someone with no brain you say (Johnny Mnemonic)? How appropriate?\". How we laughed! I hope I'm also old enough to know better now. Of course, Keanu has been in his share of bad films and has been bad in a few films too. A glance through his back catalogue will also show how many damn good movies he's been in. As I heard one critic put it recently, his strength doesn't lie with his voice so much as it does with his body. And your body is a big part of the actor's trade.We come now to the third John Wick movie, a franchise that has put Keanu centre stage in the film-goers' consciousness once more. I think the world is a better place for that. This is a series of films in which Keanu channels grief and its attendant stages - anger, denial, bargaining - through the tightly wound coil of his body, inflicting pain on anyone who crosses his path. By the end of this film, the whole set of three has only covered a few weeks of narrative at most. This is a man whose grief and his reaction to it is leading him further and further down the rabbit hole.It's utterly relentless, breathlessly entertaining. You feel every bone snap and every shattered pane of glass deep in your bones; there's wit laced with the violence too. Death by horse, death by dog, death by book (carefully placed back on the shelf in the right place afterwards, naturally). The world of assassins with a moral code is expanded and doesn't make sense, but somehow that's all part of the fun. Asia Kate Dillon is particularly good as the person who makes seemingly arbitrary decisions as to what's going on on behalf of the ever invisible High Table. There's a staggering sequence on motorbikes that I would have liked to have lasted longer. There's a direct quote from The Matrix, and several other cinematic nods besides. And there's neon. So much neon.It's balletic, stylised violence by way of John Woo and The Raid films; the sort of thing Tarantino reached for in Kill Bill but never found as conclusively as he seemed to think he had. It's absurd, but deliriously entertaining - if two hours of more or less relentless fighting and killing is what you're after. It's violence so choreographed as to not be exploitative; this is unreal violence as a spectator sport, as performance art. A man - Keanu - and others, bending bodies to their will, in service of a story and characters you come to love almost despite yourself.It's hard to imagine why you'd see this film if you didn't know what to expect; for me, it was slightly weaker than Chapter 2, which I enjoyed more than the first film. Either way, this is one just to relax and go with. The world is a better place for having Keanu back in big films on the big screen, channelling grief and anger through a body that is cartoonishly unlikely to break. Long way this wick burn.",

The only thing it gets 10/10 for is being worse than John Wick 2 if that was possible ? Well it was and they succeeded !So if you like your films to be an unintelligible tattoo convention with shoot em up first and third person shooter video game then this is the one for you - good luck .If you like gratuitous violence you'll love this - lots of knife throwing , lots of exploding heads and very little dialogue , plot or cohesion - then this is for you .The influences were clear - add the cast and more than a touch of matrix , a bit of blade runner , a big Wolfenstein 3d , doom and you've got it .There were however a few minutes of actual calm where you felt - yes this could get better - but they didn't last long .It is possible to make a video game film actually enjoyable and with a plot take Assassins Creed for example - and the first John Wick film was good but this was bad and if you didn't like John Wick 2 you'll hate this as it's worse .But maybe it's a marmite film like Blade from 20 years ago with Wesney Snipes there are people out there who loved it - I thought it was awful - we can't all like the same films - if this is your type of film enjoy - I'm sorry but I had to walk out it was just going nowhere for me .Pad.A 2/10",

Both had good story lines, action and a sense of foreboding I bought into, but... what the bloody hell happened with John Wick 3?!!In trying to find an answer I was surprised to see all 3 movies were written, directed and produced by the same people:Directed by: Chad StahelskiProduced by: Basil IwanykWritten by: Derek KolstadSo where did it go wrong??John Wick 3 starts as it means to continue, all over the place. Sure there is a lot of action but one gets the impression the team focused less on the story and more on the action.The problem is 'more' doesn't mean better and in this case is made even worse where the action is:Just too much!The fight scenes (at times) are clearly scripted. For example, the fight scene with between John Wick and the two students in the 'glass room'.The film crosses the line of 'forgiving' and goes into the realms of absurd. For example, falling from a 6 or 7 storey (yes, I did count them) building and surviving.John Wick appears to be made of sterner stuff than Kevlar...The film is a disappointing, confusing and a mess.However, this is John Wick and despite being sorely disappoint with this film, I will certainly watch John Wick 4 in the hope it is an improvement.Chad, Basil and Derek pull your socks up, as you've proven you can do better than this. Bring John Wick 4 back to the better levels of 1 & 2.And... if you would like any suggestions on how, please don't hesitate to contact me. Thanks.",

It's just one long fight scene. To make matters worse: the fight scenes were terrible.I could probably reel off 50 action heroes off the top of my head that fought better (and more realistically) than John Wick. Half of them teenage girls.The first 24 minutes of this film is a long, drawn out and boring fight scene - no story, no dialogue... just mindless pretend fighting for 24 minutes! Like watching the fight scenes from the 1960s TV series Batman. Cringe!John Wick was like one of those pixelated, slow-moving, video game character from the mid-90s. He simply doesn't pull off believable fight scenes unless it's in carefully crafted slow-motion.Was this a parody of a video game? Certainly Reeves moved like a first generation video game character. Was the limited dialogue because Keanu Reeves can't act? People must love Reeves (or video games) because anyone else in his shoes and this film would be rated a 1 - which is what I'm giving it.",

While the last act picked up steam again, I do think that the opening was the best part of the movie. Unfortunately, the middle part dragged a little and didn't make any sense storywise in retrospective - it really just seemed like a set-up for some change of environment and an action scene involving Hally Berry and dogs.Speaking of that scene, it was probably the weakest of the film, since it was devoid of any real tension and completely felt like a video game level - although that's something also the last act heavily evokes with its three \"stages\" of different enemies. Aside from that, the choreographies were superb. There won't be any better ones this year for sure, even if they never reached the style of the iconic club scene in the first film.All in all, CHAPTER 3 was kind of on par with the second movie and a satisfying cinematic experience. I hope that they wrap up the story in a final fourth installment though, because the plot was already paper-thin and character development of any sorts nowhere to be found in this film.",

Astonishingly, Wick has 100% success rate at shooting villain in very compromised positions as well. This vibe is same as Kollywood's Rajini movies where hero takes on hundreds of villains at a time without having a scratch.

The fight scenes were amazing and very well done with one caveat that is the fight scene with the Shinobi which may have been intentional because well their frickin Ninja's! Yes this movie has Frickin Ninja's In it! ohhhh Just Sooooo Good. Basically this movie doesn't fail to keep you on the edge of your seat you never know if John Wick is actually going to make it or not. Every fight feels like it good be the last. The 5minute knife room fight was definitly on of them every knife throw you cant help but think why arnt these knife hurting anyone and then a split second later some guy gets hit with four or five of them. Everything about this movie and the John Wick series so far has just been such an amazing thrill ride I for one Love these movies with such a massive amount of characters, actors and actresses that pulled this movie all together. Easily one of The Best Action Movies I Have Ever Seen and I go back to the 80s where Schwarzenegger, Van Dam and Norris were house holds names. The best part of the movie might have been the Matrix reference I balled laughing, Watching Halle Berry kick some major ass as a definite second.I Seriously and very truly hope they continue to make John Wick movies. As a Fan of the action genre in general there's been a very noticeable gap of good movies that fill that void and who better to fill it then the amazing Keanu Reeves.Cheers man!And Kudos.",

However, some story elements seem muddled and abrupt. Some head-scratching plot twists also bog the film down. The main villain is decent but not great, and that doesn't hurt the film as much as it should. The rest of the film makes up for it...Reeves gives his ideal performance here, supporting characters give fine performances too. It blows my mind watching this franchise because I believe they are all 8/10 movies. EXTREMELY ENTERTAINING and have their own strengths. Number 1 has the simplicity and more grounded story. Number 2 has the strong villain and expanded universe. Number 3 has the further expansion of the universe and the strongest action in the series. Hopeully number 4 has the strongest writting.",

I didn't expect to see a good story driven movie because i knew what i was going into but this movie got ridiculous after the second half of the movie even for a John Wick Movie. Comparing it to the 2 movies before, you could say that they had meaning and this has no such thing. Some scenes were just silly. Where i thought they made a parody of a john wick movie. Even action needs to make sense a little bit. But if people start to question the decisions made even for an action movie where the bar is really low for logic, you could just make john invincible, which he is and just start adding shooting lasers out of his eye and flying through space and call him WickMan. lol",

This is strange, because the shots appear to explode portions of the head onto any convenient background surface - yet more are needed.All I can add to this, is that the quality of assassin has gone down the toilet when they have to endlessly fight, stab and shoot each other until the director gets bored enough to decide that they can stop.The story, or what passes for it, can be told, in detail, in around twenty words - but I wouldn't want to \"spoil\" it for anyone.2/10 stars because I watched it to the end, unlike one-star movies, where I can't make it to that point.",

        "text": "Ah, JW's back! Splendid!\nYou remember how awesome The Matrix was, and how disappointing Reloaded and Revolutions seemed in comparison? Well, I had a horrible suspicion the same malais had afflicted John Wick. The first film was awesome, probably the best 'martial arts' action thriller I'd seen in years. The sequel I looked forward to enormously, but in my opinion it failed to live up to the promise of its predecessor. Don't get me wrong, I didn't hate it by any stretch - just a little disappointed. Like having another meal at your newly discovered favourite restaurant, only to discover it's not as good as before.\nJohn Wick Chapter 3: Parabellum is an entirely triumphant return to the form displayed in part 1. In fact, it's almost better. I say 'almost', because it did start to get just a tiny bit flabby toward the end, in a perhaps slightly excessive run time; maybe it would have been perfect with just a little fat trimmed off, like John Wick carving up one of the countless goons in his way. Having said that, it also raised the bar in several areas, a feat when measured against the first of its name. The world-building was introduced brilliantly, without bogging down the pace and balletic action sequences through over-lengthy exposition. A real richness and depth was added to the story arc, which neither undermined the previous chapters nor felt out of place in this one. The addition of Halle Berry and her dogs was an inspired idea; here's hoping they make it into the next one!\nSpeaking of which, there will definitely be a next one, on the strength of Chapter 3, though it'll be tough to raise the bar of excellence higher again. The basic plot may be a little predictable, but who cares when it looks so damn cool.",

        "text": "After Speed came out in 1994, I did not expect Keanu Reeves to still produce the goods in action movies 25 years later.John Wick 3 owes more than a passing nod to The Raid films. In fact two stars from that franchise appear in this movie.In the previous film, John Wick broke the rules and did an unsanctioned kill inside the Continental Hotel. Now John Wick is excommunicado and a $14 million bounty is placed on him. Every assassin is after him.The manager of the Continental, Winston (Ian McShane) has his own problems to deal with the Adjudicator sent by the High Table for helping Wick by giving him a one hour head start. Wick meanwhile needs to find a way to Morocco to find the Elder and make peace with him. Everywhere John Wick goes someone is trying to kill him.A little too long, but as brainless action films go, this was enjoyable. I particularly liked Halle Berry fighting with her two dogs. John Wick fights with knives, swords, horses, books and all kinds of guns.With two Oscar winners in the cast, director Chad Stahelski adds a bit of opulent style to the brutal action such as Russian Ballerinas trained by Anjelica Huston while protected by Belarusian heavies.",

        "text": "John Wick: Chapter 3- Parabellum (5 out of 5 stars).John Wick 3 delivers another high octane neo-noir action thriller that keeps the action exciting with bone breaking fight sequences, intense shoot outs, and an awesome stylize direction. John Wick is one of those movies that are getting better through the sequels. First one was good for a decent shoot them up action. The second tops the first with more insane action. The third does it again with more insane and exciting action. And it does leave room for more which can be the next franchise like how James Bond movies are or Mission Impossible movies. Keanu Reeves does what he does best. His performance as the ex hitman is great. And when it comes to the action. It is non stop fueled with adrenaline with a sharp direction. Director Chad Stahelski does it well with handling the action sequences. Keeping it fast, fresh, and exciting.The plot follows John (Keanu Reeves) being excommunicado by the high table. Putting a 14 million bounty on his head from every assassin out there. John tries to go where it has all started by seeing Sofia (Halle Berry) which she gives info to where he can find a member of the high table in Casablanca.The plot opens ups and expands a little further into the world of assassins, the continental, and the high table. Which gives John a reason to meet new characters like Halle Berry, the adjudicator (Asia Kate Dillon), the Elder (Said Taghmaoui), the Director (Anjelica Huston), and an assassin that is on the hunt for Wick named Zero (Mark Dacascos). With a few screenwriters and Derek Kolstad expanding the world further with the high table. It does open up for more movies which would be really cool to see were the direction goes next.The film opens up with an adrenaline rush of Wick running to find a way out with every assassin being on his trail. The opening intense fight sequence in a library does give it a brutal start. And it gets intense even further into the movie. John Wick is an unstoppable force. He can use his environment as a weapon with every object from a book in a library, having a knife fight in a bladed armory, or even escaping on horseback. One fun addition is Sofia played by Halle Berry. She has two dogs as her sidekick that follows her commands and attack on her orders. Which was one fun intense shoot out sequence.Overall, John Wick: Chapter 3- Parabellum is a great action packed thrill ride from beginning to end. If you love action, this is the film for you. With Chad Stahelski stylized and exciting direction. Keanu Reeve's delivers. The plot expands a little further into John Wick's background and were he came from. And further into the world of assassins and the high table. The film delivers as one of the best action movies ever.",

To suggest a more refreshing take on \"hitman\" movies I suggest watching the relatively new movie \"Polar\" that is criminally underrated and has all the things Parabellum lacked.",

        "text": "Where could John Wick go? And yes pun intended or rather multiple meanings implied. As you can tell by a third installment, he still had places to go, things to do and people to kill. Though his motivations are different now. While it is not necessary to have seen the other Wick movies, it does make sense. They are also quite good, if you like action flicks.So John is a persona non grata ... he is the target for other killers and who doesn't like a bounty/money? Well some may have been better off if they just passed on this \"opportunity\", but that wouldn't have made for a good movie now, would it? We also get a couple of new characters, portrayed by Halle Berry and Marc Dacascos. The latter may be the main antagonist, but he is very likely to become a favorite for a lot of audience members. Amongst all the action and mayhem (not for kids then), there is quite some wicked humor. It is necessary to lighten up the whole thing, not because of any need to cover for bad stunts - quite the opposite is the case. The choreography is top notch once again and there is no fatigue breaking in ... well bring on Part 4 then",

        "text": "The way I see it, \"John Wick\" is a progressive series. What started as a simply good action movie evolved more and more over the years. It seems that the director/ex-stuntman Chad Stahelski finally reached a point where you can feel he knows exactly what he is doing. \"Chapter 3\" is a visual, dynamic, confident adventure which feels made by a team on full focus. \"John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum\" is one of the great action flicks.This movie knows exactly what it wants. It spends nearly no time arguing, blabbering or attempting drama. We join John Wick exactly where we left him in the prequel. On the streets of New York City with his unnamed dog clutching at his life as the clock is ticking down to when his life is officially for sale--for about 14 million dollars, and increasing! Not soon enough Wick (Keanu Reeves) meets his first assassin attempting to collect. He defeats him, of course, but not without taking some damage himself. Yet again, Stahelski continues on abusing his protagonist but the fact that he is not untouchable only makes him more fascinating and powerful.John Wick is a survivor in this third installment. The fact that he is more and more embedded in the criminal underworld only makes his tacit attitude more precise. Every time he opens his mouth the plot moves forward. But let's not forget why he is here--consequences. His only wish is to live to remember his wife, he never ignited the fire in the first place. Like Tony Montana said: \"I never 'messed with' anybody over in my life who didn't have it coming to them\". But John Wick is the polar opposite to Montana. He is elegant, respectful of his enemies even when he constantly has to look over his shoulder.This movie, then, does not bother with insightful meaning. But that's OK because this film is clear on what is about. Even one of Wick's few friends left, Sofia (Halle Berry) who looked like she was going to play a contiguous partner for him, is only episodic--like everyone. John seems to be the only true constant when it comes to friends and foes but with action scenes on Jackie Chan levels of choreography he can handle them both.",

This gives the audience just enough time to prepare themselves before the film's continuous combat scenes that never stales from its thrill. The parts were Wick fights his killers while on a motorcycle and a horse is as attention-grabbing as the movie gets: ongoing combat while simultaneously traveling is a nice addition to the trilogy's set of action sequences, complemented by its appealing visuals to set the mood for a specific fight scene.This third film also has no shortage of a bright and diverse cast, with the addition of people such as Halle Berry, Boban Marjanovic (a present player of the NBA's 76ers), as well as Yayan Ruhian and Cecep Arif Rahman (well known for their roles in The Raid). Each person brings more color and personality to the film which adds more to the film, making it probably the most exciting out of the three John Wick movies.Towards the end of the film is where John Wick starts to disappoint. I still believe that the film should've taken the alternative direction as to what actually happened towards the end, which really impacts my overall rating of the film. I won't say much so as not to spoil the film for those who haven't seen it yet, but John Wick had a purpose as to why he wanted to escape death. I, myself, asked the very same question why he went through all the trouble, and Wick's reason for this was very much felt. However, the conclusion feels as if what Wick went through in the end was pointless after the final decision he chose even after the sacrifice he made and what became of him.Overall, this is a very well made thrilling action blockbuster that doesn't fall short of its expectations. Though the ending could have preferably been different, John Wick: Chapter 3 is every bit as good, if not better, in terms of action sequences, from its two previous prequels, and is worth seeing for that reason alone.",

        "text": "Wick 1 and 2 are the new action movie. In the mold of Borne, every Avenger movie and Fast and the Furious, the film's plot is a near invincible ninja slaughtering scores of baddies with a whisk of their finger to finally face off against another near invincible character in an epic fight. And how good Wick does this formula - way better than the other films for my money.However, the third installment, Parabellum, is a step behind the first two. And, I'm not entirely sure why. Action, check. quirky characters, check. Great visual style and sound, check, check.So, where does it fall short? I think this is summed up when one of the characters (not intentionally ironically of course) asks Wick \"Why do you keep doing this?\" Neither of us had a good answer. More for the sake of more, maybe? Because?I enjoyed the film because it's a spectacle, but so are most action films these days. Why Wick was different was the style and world it existed in. But style is only stylish for so long, and the world didn't hold up as well as it should/could have.It's a good watch, just not special like the first 2.",

        "text": "This third instalment had nowhere further it could go yet tried to go there anyway. It's by no means poor but doesn't match the previous films heights. The first two films found the bleeding edge of all in action. Parabellum tries to go further and necessarily ends up being a film that's dangerously close to parodying itself and that's where this film lives - in the space between full-on and parody with the fight in the knife armoury being an example as is their spokeswoman who remains bafflingly immune from any harm or even attempted harm by some unspoken pact. You never get the feeling that it's completely lost it but that thought is constantly hovering. A few of the action scenes come across as choreographed too which I never felt in the first two and the \"high table\" top villains seem to be caricatures, living in some alternate reality adding to that sense of the line being at least probed if not outright crossed.\nHalle Berry does a fine job as do the dogs. It's by no means a bad film but simply had a high standard to aspire to but couldn't match. As ever each individual will draw their own line between full-on and parody. If you move the line (only a little) one way it becomes a great film whilst a nudge the other leaves you disbelieving.",

It was stylish, cool, and had an air of ambiguity about the world John used to be a part of. The characters were fantastic, despite not fully knowing about them.The second one was a bit of a let down overall. It had some decent action, but the drive behind the movie that the first had was lost and I didn't care for it from a storytelling perspective. But it was still enjoyable from a non-stop action standpoint. The story with John owing that guy a favor really wasn't as intriguing as the first's set-up of the universe. The 2nd almost showed too much of their secret world.I wasn't as interested to see the third after the previous one wasn't as compelling. But I figured I'd see John Wick to the end anyways.This one is definitely a step up from the second movie, but it still lacking the narrative to make it fully compelling. Sure, these movies AREN'T going to be a storytelling masterpiece. These movies are about the practical action and pretty much that.The story in this one is essentially John is on the run after breaking the a cardinal rule of the assassin world. He goes to various people from his past to get help, but in the background a messenger from the controlling board of the assassins visits each person who helped John throughout the past movie. It's a compelling enough story to help showcase the amazing action scenes, but it's not as interesting as the first movie was.There is a lull in the middle where John goes to the desert to find a special person that just seemed so unneeded. They could have cut that out and made the movie a bit more compact. Especially when he agrees to something, then literally goes back on the agreement 10 minutes later.This movie is about the action set pieces and it excels in those. Many of them I still have no idea how they did them. It is a masterpiece when it comes to that aspect. Some of the fist fight scenes do feel like they go on a little too long, especially one towards the end with a duo of Asian actors.Most of the fights you have to leave realism outside before watching them, but they're still really entertaining in the long run.JW3 continues the streak of having some of the best movie action ever filmed, so see it on that merit. I still think that JW1 is still the best overall as it has a much more compelling plot and better set of characters.",

Parrabelum is SO MANY MILE AHEAD from the second chapter. As expected , deeper background of EVERYTHING (backstory of Wick himself, High Table, universe expansion).\nChapter 2 was the worst from this trilogy, third part is the best because is not so linear , predictable and non-enjoyable (for multiple viewings) as second or first part.

All you need to see kick-off your weekend with the latest chapter in the hit franchise - John Wick 3With 14 million bounty on his head after killing a member of the assassin fraternity, John Wick becomes the center of attraction as he must race against time to defend himself from every one in the world who comes his way.Continuing his series of action and beautiful stunts, director Chad Stahelski goes one step further with raw and real stunts that will take your breath away.\nIf you have liked John Wick part 1 and 2, John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is an icing on the cake. The movie starts with a bang as Keanu Reeves a.k.a John Wick goes all the possible way to protect himself as the bounty reaches new peak high when he fights a tall guy at the library and knocks him out with a library book. As he steps out the doctor's chamber, he faces the goons where he fights with knives and swords which is brilliantly choreographed followed by an eye-popping fight at the horse stable. There is a chase scene where John Wick rides the horse followed by the goons on the book. I would like to highlight that this probably one of the best chase scenes I have seen in my life. I just got out of my chair and clapped as if my joy knew no bounds.The film comes back to a more relaxed mode as the story forwards to Morocco. As Halle Berry enters the scene, the movie becomes even more interesting.\nThere is an electrifying and brilliantly performed gun blazing scenes which last for a good 7 minutes and is worth-watching, especially a dog jumping on the back of Halle Berry as she bows down and climbs the roof to grab the goon. If you think this is enough, hold on as there is a high-octane bike chase scene with jaw-dropping stunts. The movie might become little monotonous but the wonderful choreography in the climax at the glass room is outstanding. The makers have given a hint which will boar yet another chapter which will hit the theater next on 21st May, 2021.As I said this is a movie who love action films and should be respected as each and every choreography is worth clapping. The movie goes very well with electrifying background score composed by Tyler Bates and Joel J. Richard. Art direction is superb while Cinematography is eye-catching. Writing by Derek Kolstad, Shay Hatten, Chris Collins and Marc Abrams is engaging and does not blink your eye for a minute.John Wick could only be played by one and the only Keanue Reaves. The actor not only emotes well with his expression but is fantabulous with his hand combats and action stunts. I loved Halle Berry as she brings in spark once she enters the scenes, even though for few minutes. Ian Mcshane and Laurence Fishburne are as usual dependable.Overall, if you are in need for some kick-ass action film, John Wick 3 is the right dose for you. Electrifying 4.5/5",

If there is something wrong that I must say is that it is only action and action again, in the end I was already tired of so much fighting after fighting; I would have liked a better script, because it lacks development and 2 hours 10 minutes seemed long at the end; they take off 20 and it looks good, or rather, they leave 20 but with a better plot development. Another thing is that they want to force Halle Berry's character, Sophia, to ask for more of her (by the way her dogs are amazing), they show her a lot and they take away Keanu Reeves's weight in the scene to get me a spin-off, but I prefer the Common of the second installment. And finally, they went through the verisimilitude of the film, there is one thing in the end that I do not buy. It is not the end of a trilogy, now is when it begins and we have a UNBOUND John for the fourth. I already want to see more.",

        "text": "The previous two \"John Wick\" movies were quite good, filled with action and had adequate storylines. And the \"John Wick\" movies definitely is what brought Keanu Reeves back on the map for me. So of course I had to watch \"John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum\" as well.Wow. Just wow! That is essentially all that needs to be said to summarize this third installment in the series. John Wick (played by Keanu Reeves) is back and better than ever.This third movie continues on from the previous two movies, but it kicks up the action and adrenaline a notch. Quite a notch actually. This was an action-fest in every sense of that term. From the very beginning to the very end, there wasn't a single dull moment to be had. And director Chad Stahelski really brought the audience along on an action thrill ride like none other.Not only is this third installment in the series more action packed, but it also hosts multiple great acting performances by some rather interesting casted talents. I must admit that I had my doubts about Halle Berry, but she really surprised me here with her performance as Sofia and proved that she really can hold her own in an action movie such as \"John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum\". And of course Keanu Reeves needs little praise here, because he is back in top form and I dare even say that the \"John Wick\" movies are his best movies in his entire career thus far. Now, Ian McShane is always a treat in anything he is in, with his cool demeanor and charm, and he is so well cast for the role of Winston. I was looking forward to seeing Mark Dacascos in this movie, and I am so glad that he is here, because he is really getting to prove his worth in a major blockbuster movie here, and he definitely should get rekognition for this movie. I am also glad to see Yayan Ruhian in a movie such as this, because with his martial arts skills he is worthy of movies such as this.I can honestly say that \"John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum\" is non-stop enjoyable action from start till end, and also comes with a good continuation of the story of the John Wick character. And needless to say, I am really looking forward to the fourth movie in the series.The action sequences in \"John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum\" were great and nicely choreographed and equally so executed on the screen. There is so much adrenaline in it and it feels like you are right there in the chaotic action yourself. I thoroughly enjoyed this aspect of the movie.While\"John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum\" is not a movie that by any means challenges the intellect of the audience, it is definitely a movie that sweeps you off your feet and takes you along on an action-packed ride.If you've seen the previous two \"John Wick\" movies, you definitely need to watch \"John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum\". Trust me.",

Again operating in a glorious world of hyper-realistic action-a la Bourne, Craig-era Bond and Mission: Impossible-this third instalment delivers more close-quarter combat that is gritty but stylistic, brutal but beautiful, and downright exhilarating. Franchise director Chad Stahelski is not resting on his laurels after taking the world by storm with the first two chapters, upping his game here to include fights on motorbikes, extended one-shot takes involving attack dogs, and Wick battling through downtown New York on a horse. Yep, a horse. A long and esteemed career in stunt choreography has served Stahelski well in the director's chair, his commitment to unbroken shots, a steady camera and preparing his cast to do as much of the fisticuffs as possible allows him to deliver hard-hitting thrills rarely seen in big-budget action blockbusters. Of course a lot of credit also goes to Keanu Reeves, the 55-year-old willing to go the extra mile to ensure he's as convincing as possible as an unstoppable death-dealing badass who's as lethal with a gun as he is with a knife or his bare hands. Only Tom Cruise rivals Reeves' fitness, ferocity and dedication to putting on an action extravaganza. The balletic gunplay aside, this sequel also builds on the fantastical assassin-universe of the series. With its safe-haven hotels, opera-loving people smugglers, desert-residing gangsters and strictly followed criminal rules, this is pure, highfalutin melodrama that is somehow tonally perfect for these movies. Inventive, adrenaline-pumping and two-barrels full of fun, Parabellum continues this franchise's impressive run.",

        "text": "After being disappointed with the second movie I still had quite high expectations from this one because JW series certainly has potential. Unfortunately, this movie suffers from several conspicuous things.Firstly, acting is unbelievably two-dimensional. Absolutely no one, not even Halle Berry, delivered any other emotion other than desire to kill and even that one was delivered poorly. About 90% of time actors look like angry ten-year old's after their toy had been taken from them.Secondly, action becomes boring after seeing the first half of the movie. This is a major one since action sequences is all JW has to offer.Thirdly, story is nonexistent. This may not seem as a big problem since JW series don't pretend having one. But give as at least something! This story vacuum influences the way action sequences are ordered. That is why they become boring after the first hour or so: nothing happens in between and so they occur in a similar fashion.Fourthly, movie never creates any tension. Remember the bank robbery scene from Heat? Until the action starts you're already at the edge of your seat! There's not anything like that in this movie. And again, action, which is pretty much everything JW has to offer, becomes monotone.Fifthly, there's a lot of occult symbolism in the movie and the violence sometimes becomes awful. The entire movie looks, at least for me, like it was made by a group of satanists.In conclusion, this movie suffers from a grave lack of moderateness in every area. Avoid it unless being a JW fan.",

        "text": "John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is technically the best of the John Wick films but it is also the worst in terms of story and character development. John Wick's story and motives take a backseat to the world-building and competing motives of the supporting characters. Parabellum is more about the High Table than John Wick's struggle. Overall, Parabellum is a stepdown from both its predecessors, thus making it the weakest of the trilogy so far.Parabellum has many strengths that overcome its weak writing mainly Ian McShane as Winston, Mark Dacascos as Zero, and the requisite all-out action scenes. Halle Berry as Sofia and Lance Reddick as Charon contribute as well. The subplot revolving the internal struggle of the High Table made for some really good character moments mostly through Ian McShane and Laurence Fishburne. The finale's twist is the film's biggest shock.Chapter 2 gave a bigger scope to the John Wick world; Parabellum extends it further. Chapters 1 and 2 are hard to top, yet somehow, director Chas Stahelski has perfected his craft with Parabellum. The museum, Kasbah, and room of mirror fights are gloriously choreographed coupled with fantastic direction. Zero is also the best John Wick villain by far. The action scenes drown the drama though and feel gratuitous. John Wick starts on the run but by the end of the film, after Winston's seeming betrayal, seeming because an ulterior motive to temporarily keep the peace against the High Table is possible, we see him eager to directly confront his enemies.On a side note, Parabellum seems more like an extension to Chapter 2 than as a separate film itself. The ending firmly establishes John Wick's turnaround from avoiding his previous life to facing them, hopefully in a satisfying and definitive conclusion in the sequel.6/10",

What works in film's favour are breathtaking action sequences, especially a scene in a horse's stable and on a bridge (overpass) with Wick fighting off bikers. It is expertly directed and edited. John Wick is still as mean as ever. What doesn't work in film's favour is the following: nonexistent script or a poor attempt of a story and the fact that it doesn't end as a trilogy. There is a scene that I would've made differently, when Wick is in a desert looking for a way out, in that particular moment he would start hallucinating because of dehydration, be under illusion of seeing his dead wife Helen, looking gently at him and as soon as he'd reach his hand towards her, she'd disappear. When this film first came out, a sequel was obvious and expected. I have been looking forward to seeing this third chapter for a long time and now after watching it, I only hope for a better developed screenplay and characterisation in a fourth chapter. Until then tick-tack.",

This movie has potential to be my favorite but unfortunately is not because of the few flaws that get in the way.The movie is probably my favorite in terms of the moments without action, some of these locations are really cool and interesting to me, but feel like they go on too long. In fact the first 20 minutes of this film is amazing. It has hilarious and fun action along with a quick start, John Wick immediately needs to prepare and it's super tense. But after that, it feels like the movies goes on for around just 30-40 minutes of story related stuff. Although I do enjoy it a lot, I am mostly here for the action, something the second movie did that I like is that it had pretty much no story. It sets up a plot, but as time goes by you also get to learn the lore of the continental which was great. But despite that one pretty big issue I have with the film, the action is the best it has been. It's hilarious, unique and entertaining. Another thing I enjoy about it, is that John Wick goes to a vast amount of areas which makes the environment change a lot which was refreshing.",

It is certainly a fast paced, action packed movie that has no problem holding your attention, but a shadow of what the original was. Just my 2 cents.",

This is a movie of \"wouldn't it be cool if X happened?\", which is an ideology associated with Snider, and we all know how good his Superman, BvS and Justice League movies are..Still, it has it's moments, great cinematography and editing to make someone paying attention have fun with the way they do things. Nothing else.\nWho is this meant for? The people that got super excited with that horse scene in the trailer? Because it ain't worth it.There is a lack of decent characters, meaningful dialogue, or a good story. The only way I can explain this movie existing, is if they made it to give a bunch of people that do stunts, a job.. Then! I would be fine with it. Otherwise, it is completely forgettable and dull.I could not recommend this to anyone, and I feel sorry for anyone that watched it in a theater.",

Fast forward a week and having just watched John Wick 3 the only thing I can say is WOW! From the get go it is action all the way, with Keanu Reeves at his brilliant best. The film never lets up, but unlike some out and out action films this has a really good and intriguing plot. As others have said in their reviews the choreography of the fight scenes is just mind blowing and when you think the action will stop for a bit it just goes again. Fight after fight, it is just amazing.Avengers End Game might make all the headlines this year with the money it makes but it is not a patch on John Wick 3. Any action film lover has got to watch this film. It will leave you smiling from ear to ear. All I have left to say is bring on John Wick 4!!!",

The second film was surprisingly beautiful, exhilarating, and even quite moving. It expanded the mythology of the film's world in a way that was evocative, mysterious, and engaging. The third film... meh. I was quite bored throughout most of it.The first fight is pretty awesome. The second fight is visually stunning and quite inventive. But then the movie settles into a groove from which it never escapes. The fights stop being surprising. They drag on far too long, and there are no real reversals. (John Wick is pretty much always winning, that is to say.) The violence becomes cartoonish and stops having any visceral impact.The characters are all so hollow and interchangeable that it doesn't matter how many dozens of them are being killed. New characters like \"The Adjudicator\" and Sofia are atrociously acted. (Anjelica Huston is pretty intriguing in her brief scenes.) The mythology is stretched to its limits and quickly crosses over from evocative to stupid. At one point, John Wick walks into the Sahara Desert, where just past the point of death he will supposedly come face-to-face with the godlike man who \"sits above the Table\" and somehow sees everything and is in charge of this entire assassins' world. You'd think that character would be something really unexpected, like Kathy Bates feeding a tame rabbit and talking about how violence solves nothing; instead, that character is the most stereotypically dull criminal mastermind you can possibly imagine living in the Sahara Desert, and he sends John Wick on a high-stakes mission that in fact makes no sense at all once you take two seconds to think about it.I was zoned out for most of the movie. I thought maybe I was just in a bad movie, but the three friends I saw it with also agreed that it was thoroughly disappointing. Maybe John Wick: Chapter 9 - Geriatrum will revitalize the series.",

        "text": "Action scenes that become repetitive and boring after a while and a few irritating and unnecessary characters. Roughly, that's how the weakest sequel to the John Wick franchise to date could be described.Mark Dacascos is a great addition to the John Wick universe, and Laurence Fishburne is excellent in the role of Bowery King. Yes, this is definitely the weakest sequel, too repetitive, with really irritating characters, barely saved by Laurence Fishburne and Mark Dacascos who are really great in their roles.Unfortunately, the film has turned into a parody that we often see in today's films, filled with pretentious and overly stylized clichés and completely unnecessary and irritating characters who are there just to fill in the gaps. The worst in the film is not a completely repetitive action, a lack of story, completely unnecessary and boring characters, the worst in the film is definitely The Adjudicator, an irritating character who simply makes the film difficult to watch and destroys any desire to watch the film again.In short, the weakest sequel to the franchise, boring, with irritating characters, repetitive and shallow.",

        "text": "\"John Wick Chapter 3: Parabellum\" Review\n(9/10)I have never been the biggest fan of the John Wick franchise. I gave both the previous movies a 7/10, but Parabellum brings the title character back to his roots while also offering new twists to where things could go from here, all with the over-the-top, brutally executed action set-pieces fans have come to expect from the franchise.\nWe learn much more of John's backstory here, which reveals some interesting facets to his character, all while also seeing him take one helluva prolonged beating along the way. John Wick is a human piñata at this point and Chapter 3 gets a lot of traction out of seeing him punched, stabbed, kicked, shot, and tossed around. Keanu Reeves once again owns the screen as this most sympathetic of good bad men, providing another emotionally restrained performance even while clearly giving it his all physically. And does he - and this movie - ever deliver in the action department!\nChapter 3 offers a relentless onslaught of action set-pieces, each one as bloody brilliant as the one that came before it. There are a million ways to die in this movie, all of them executed in the most visceral, \"did they really just do that?!\" fashion that fans have come to expect. Each action set-piece builds upon the ridiculous brutality of the previous one, but there's one particular sequence in Casablanca that some gamers may especially get a kick out of for its elaborate staging and immersiveness.\nChapter 3 is also visually stunning just like Chapter 2. Neatly choreographed violence has always been the best part of this franchise and John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is no different. In fact, it's better. Keanu Reeves dances his way through fights using every object in his vicinity to deal fatal blows. He is equally adept at fighting with a book as he is with a gun. The film is littered with fight scenes and whatever happens in between serves to set up the next one. The sets, cinematography, and lights are as gorgeous as they have been in the other two films.\nYou came to see the action in the first 2, and now with Parabellum you get even better action and a rich story that dives into John Wick's backstory. Combat-heavy pulp of the highest order, this is the most enjoyably over-the-top entry so far.",

        "text": "John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is good but suffers from its eccentricities. It is a very well made, interesting and flawed. The main problem with the film is it feels like it 'jumps the shark' a little and whilst this isn't full 'jump the shark' it does go far enough over that the thread of believability even in a stylised world goes to pot at times.So you have 2 options to ignore the silliness or just go along for the ride. Fortunately, there is a lot to ride on and the film never gets boring or dull.The action is excellent and the fight scenes are stunning, occasionally slight over gruesome and often very funny but always exceptionally well done.The new characters are a mixed bag, with some far more successful than others, with Halle Berry's character standing out above all, in what is her best action role.As for the main protagonist, Mark Dacascos is interesting and at times odd and I am not not sure the humorous touches quite work.The more established characters such as Winston and Charon, have more to do in this film but several of the other characters from previous films do go missing in this film.As for Keanu Reeves, he plays John Wick in a very similar way to the first 2 films.The directing and cinematography are excellent, as has been the case with the last 2 films. Chad Stahelski plays to the films strengths and there is very little time to step back and relax.So despite my problems with the film I did enjoy it and would recommend it to others who enjoyed the last couple of films.",

What amazes me is this film is actually showing a near 8 out of 10! Does story no longer matter these days as long as our protagonist turned bullet sponge killing machine is always in a fight scene at least once every 5-10 minutes?So yeah the first one was good, the second was not so good and the third is worse than the second and they left it open for a Chapter 4? Maybe they will listen to real critics and make an effort on the story this time but the way the movie industry is going it doesn't seem too likely. These people live their whole lives with their head up their own arses and criticism will just be construed as \"hating\" just as it was with Ghostbusters 2016.Does this review contain spoilers? What's to spoil?",

We are given bare bones story details and clear as day objectives for each of our characters. From there, we are swept away into long and creative action sequences that have some of the best sound design I have heard, particularly with the shootouts. John Wick will continue to be a franchise to not miss in the coming years.",

Once again every enemy has every chance to kill wicks, the sit an talk to him.. They even help him back onto his feet after beating him half to death! So for that it's pretty silly. When the bad guys do get him, they choose to toy with him until he breaks free again an kills them all.. Like seriously, just put a bullet in his head instead of tough talking! The final fight between wicks and zero and his men is really good, tho goofy at times it's still fast and slick. The supporting cast are a mixed bag.. You have A listers mixed with the likes of jerome! That is crazy, the dude couldn't act or sing in the 90s an yet here he is in a Hollywood blockbuster.. Fair play to him for that.. lol.\nAs I said, Keano carries this one. The first chapter was a great revenge movie, the 2nd was OK but started to go abit off the rails.. This one tho becomes like a video game.. John heads out on a pointless quest.. Looses his finger, gets his ass kicked time and time again. The dogs were epic, and praise to the choreography guys on that.. If they do make another one I hope they bring it back to end it.. There's alot of good moments in this one but you really can see during the fights that some of the extras wernt up for it. One scene you see wicks waiting for the man with the sword to strike as he holds his hands in the counter position.. Was just strange that the editors didn't fix those problems.\nI'd watch it again as I did enjoy it. I just hope the 4th movie will end the franchise before it sinks even deeper into fantasy.. There's alot of goofy elements. I hope the 4th one is able to close the franchise.\nTho I enjoyed it, I do think keano carried it.",

I get it, movies are entertainment, but this movie totally lacks a solid story-line, it is merely a drawn out continuation of John Wick II. No kidding, right? But this one to me just hit way off target. I felt as if I had waited for absolutely nothing , and I loved John Wick and John Wick II completely solid, well written movies and I enjoyed them. However this one I felt cheated on, so two stars.",

If you like heavy doses of highly choreographed hand-to-hand fight scenes, endless supplies of black-clad assassins, and lots of point-blank small-arms fire, the John Wick films are for sure the place to come. This third instalment goes over the top even by its own standards, and knows that it's doing it. You can't help shake your head at it all, but you can't help enjoying it anyway. After the baseline set in the first John Wick outing that set its own distinctive style, this third one is now purely in a fantasy realm of its own glorious excess.Not a whole lot more to say that's relevant. It's all in how well they do it, and this one succeeds in giving the audience more of the same while adding inventive new approaches just when you think you've seen everything. It effectively uses the continuing characters from the first two (Winston, Charon, Bowery King) while elaborating further on the mysterious High Table. Personally, I liked the absurdly long but engaging centerpiece action sequence, where Keanu is fighting alongside Halle Berry, two dogs, and the obligatory string of thugs who keep popping up from behind walls, fountains, statues -- everywhere. That sequence is in Casablanca because {reasons} but it's more like sure, why not.I'm not sure how they can top all this in the upcoming Chapter 4 (2022).",

If you're not one of the oversupply of supercritical people who are no doubt each turning out their own screenplays and movies, then you're pretty impressed by this one. I don't see how the producers, actors and crews do this sort of thing. I'm sure that the CGE computers were overheating, but still... for example, the huge fight scene with the Arabs: Two or more big dogs seem to take direction quite well, running and jumping to chomp on bad guys. And 53 year-old Halle Berry proves she has the \"fighting skills\" of Charlize Theron, Milla Jovovich, or any of the female action stars. And Keanu... I mean, he's in REALLY good shape, but how do you do that stuff, including hitting the floor a LOT, and not be... dead? You have to be dedicated to a very healthful lifestyle.\nAnd I can't wait for my next streusel and frosting-laden \"cactus bread\" from Pizza Ranch.",

It is the third installment in the 'John Wick' film series.\nThe third installment in what I hoped would be one of the greatest action trilogies. By the ending of this film, it looks like we can expect yet another sequel to this crazy action franchise. I'm not complaining by any means, I have enjoyed every movie that has come so far, I just miss trilogies.\nSuper-assassin John Wick (Keanu Reeves) returns with a $14 million price tag on his head and an army of bounty-hunting killers on his trail. After killing a member of the shadowy international assassin's guild, the High Table, John Wick is excommunicado, but the world's most ruthless hit men and women await his every turn.\nSequels normally get worse as they go on. But, not John Wick. These movies get more intense with each movie. The overall concept of all three of these movies are basically the same. Each has a lot of killing with great action scenes. None really stand out to me as the best in the franchise, but I do enjoy each one of them.\nThe pacing of this film is also incredible. It starts the action immediately and almost never lets up. The only problem is when the death count is as high as this film, the movie can struggle to keep the originality up. After a while each death starts to look very similar to the last, and the 50 before that, and it can even become a little tedious to watch.\nOverall, this movie is two hours of your life that will pass by very quickly. This is as non-stop action as films get.\nSo, that's my review John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum, let me know in the comments below if you seen this movie, and let me know your grade for it. Keep and eye open for more reviews to come!\n4/5",

        "text": "The John Wick franchise, like Fast and the Furious is one of those franchises you have to grade on the quality of the action rather than the quality of its story. Neither of the first two John Wick films had a remarkable story, so the John Wick experience is really about enjoying one of the greatest action stars of his generation doing what he does best in the most creative of ways--killing bad guys. Killing lots of them.For the third installment in the John Wick franchise, Keanu Reeve's and Halle Berry guarantee you will not survive any drinking game based on their character's kill counts. If you thought John Wick killed a lot of people in the first two movies, then you're going to need a calculator for this gun-fu ode to Bruce Lee's Game of Death. Keanu continues to master the art of injury-limping through his films and finding the energy necessary to eviscerate one guy after the next. He's done it so much throughout his career that you sometimes fail to appreciate how talented he is as a real action star during some of his scenes--you expect it. That's not a knock on him, that's a tribute to how good Keanu is at these types of roles.What was a surprise was Halle Berry's fantastic sequence of kills that looked like the spawning of her own franchise with the intensity and length of her fight sequence. Anyone who's ever tried to collect alimony from Halle Berry should seriously try to reimburse her after seeing this. She was gloriously vicious in this movie.The opening scene's kill in the library was without a doubt, the movie bad guy kill of the year in a movie full of award-winning fatalities (if there were such a thing). It's a franchise brimming over with mind-numbing violence that still finds ways to always make you squeamish.One of two problems with John Wick 3 is the organizational structure of the fight scenes. You expect a movie to open strong, settle down, and build to a crescendo. Unfortunately, some of the best fights happen earlier in the film, leaving the ending fight filling a bit anti-climatic. The other is a lost opportunity to use to more moments of humor to liven up a movie that occasionally becomes so repetitive that you're just waiting for it to end. One of my favorite scenes from the first John Wick film was John killing multiple guys in his home and having the police stop by and totally ignore it like it was just another day in this neighborhood. Moments of levity mixed with action are the hallmarks of this franchise. This movie gets it half right and that's not an entirely bad thing, because the other half is what John Wick fans came for--Keanu Reeves reminding you that he is the best action star in the world.",

The first film was a brilliant revenge story, the 2nd added more, the 3rd maybe the best.John Wick chapter 3 continues straight off we're chapter 2 finished so I recommend watching that just prior before going watching the movie. Let's start with the action, absolutely fantastic, I actually wanted to stand up & clap after every action scene, amazing stuff, the direction as well was top notch again, no shaky cam, no camera switch's every 5 seconds, just long continual shots were you will see all the action, the film looks beautiful as well so props to the cinematography, also props to anyone involved in the movie.Keanu Reeves again fantastic stunt work & is probably 1 the best action hero stars ever. Also Halle Berry, amazing as well,Great continuation of the story, building on a fantastic universe they have created, I'm so glad movies like this are still being made & dare I say this should be in contention for a few Oscar nominations.And thank you to everyone involved in the film, i will definitely be going watching it again 👏👏👏👏👏",

        "text": "In this modern age of gigantic blockbusters being the only real successful action films the John Wick series is a marvel (...no pun intended). John Wick is the lone bright spot in the mid-budget action genre that stands out among the crowd. We're in an era where Jason Statham and Liam Neeson release 1-2 generic action films a year with the odd gem intermixed (The Grey is amazing), but somehow Keanu Reeves' titular John Wick stands at the head of the crowd - while also putting a bullet through the skull of all who stand in his way.John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum (...I'll just call it John Wick 3 for short) is what was originally rumored to be the climax of the John Wick saga; a series that it was widely reported that several people in the production were afraid it would overstay its welcome. John Wick 3 isn't the end of Wick's story; though the end is in sight. Director Chad Stahelski instead uses John Wick 3 to set up what promises to be a highly entertaining finale to the series; John Wick 3 is definitely worth the watch but it might disappoint anyone who expected a firm conclusion.Following the events of John Wick: Chapter 2 where Wick killed a member of the High Table on Continental grounds, Wick is declared Excomunicado and has his Continental privileges revoked while also having a High Table endorsed $14-million bounty on his head. Wick must then fight his way through New York with no Continental safe-harbor, hundreds of assassins hunting him, and seemingly no hope. Meanwhile the High Table has sent an Adjudicator to pass judgment on Wick's allies who helped him kill and walk away from his murder of a member of the High Table. Will Wick make it out alive? What does the High Table have planned? Well, there's a John Wick 4 coming so you can guess part of that.I find that John Wick 3 is the first time this series has actually dealt with the entire world of this assassin order, and it makes for a much more interesting film. The High Table was brought up in Chapter 2, but here it is this unstoppable force that binds the universe and dispenses punishment that most are too afraid to resist. The line \"rules and consequences\" is repeated throughout by many characters; the bill comes due, always. Most consequences involve those who have dealt with John Wick, whose own \"angel of death\" mantra now applies to those who dared to help him. It was lightly touched on in Chapter 2 where Wick's past came back to bite him in the ass, but in Chapter 3 it seems that no one is safe from the harm that simply being associated with John Wick incurs. It's a neat development for the series: the world finally starts to fully take shape.I wish to cut down the fears of those that had doubt that the series could keep up its torrid pace: John Wick 3 continues the series' trademark stylized action set pieces in glorious and unexpected fashion. This series rivals the Mission: Impossible films in terms of somehow providing you with things you've never seen before. While one might have expected the series to somehow have Wick headshot his way to the top of the Statue Of Liberty, it instead remains grounded; though there are sets in this movie that are astoundingly beautiful to just look at. The cinematography and sets are still top-rate and really do cement this as the best series of action films to just look at and enjoy. Helping matters this time is that Wick actually has some help in some of the fight scenes so it ups the ante with Wick fighting alongside people who also can kick ass; Halle Berry and her pair of pups are by far the standout.Keanu Reeves remains his gloriously stoic self as his bodycount reaches the hundreds. At this point Wick might have surpassed Neo as the iconic Reeves character; with a few emotional scenes highlighting the inner struggle that Wick faces throughout the carnage. Reeves' ability to perform such intense action scenes while remaining as, well, Wickian as he is is perhaps the most underrated part of this film. Ian McShane gets a lot more time to chew the scenery as Winston in his vaguely maniacal hotel owner role - long overdue if I say so myself for his role to become central to the plot. Lance Reddick finally gets to do things in this film as Continental concierge Charon, and as a Reddick fan I am appreciative of him finally getting a chance to kick ass. Lawrence Fishboure returns as well for another cameo and my word do I want to see a film about The Bowery King and his pigeon armada. Most of the new characters fit well in this world, with the highlights being Halle Berry's Sofia and Mark Dacascos' Zero getting the most deserved attention. However, I feel there is one addition that detracts from the whole.The biggest distraction in John Wick 3 is Asia Kate Dillon's performance as the Adjudicator. She looks the part of some cocky, evil judge and jury; but she lacks the finish as an executioner. Dillon's voice and body language don't intimidate at all in a role that I feel should have gone to someone like Tilda Swinton, Lena Heady, or Lauren Cohen - you know, actors who naturally intimidate you. All the other pieces fit perfectly in this world - hell Angelica Huston's Ruska Roma ballerina assassin teacher even makes sense - Dillion just feels like an actor desperately trying to channel something that doesn't come naturally to them. The Adjudicator's only defense seems to be that she knows that she can't be harmed, lest the High Table take action; this makes her as imposing as your boss's nephew. She's essentially the main antagonist on paper, and her lack of presence hurts the film in ways that could have been avoided. Santino D'Antonio in Chapter 2 was similar but at least he had the slimey, charismatic personality to add to the performance; you feared him because he himself showed the power he had control over. Maybe if they had her doing anything remotely intimidating it would work better, but instead she has hired goons do her dirty work out of the fear of the High Table's power, not herself; and the goons are a thousand times more awesome than her!John Wick 3 is easy to recommend to fans of the series, or fans of action in general; but it did leave me wanting more in an annoying way. John Wick 3 might be the best of the series, but it also is the one that left me feeling the most empty. Large parts of John Wick 3 seem like they are color to fill out the world but remain pointless and could have easily been cut out in favor of delivering a satisfying story. The Ruska Roma part for example only adds flavor to the universe as well as fills in a tad of Wick's backstory, but you could cut those 10 minutes and lose nothing (note: yes I know of the rumored Ballerina film that this segment might have loosely set up, but my point remains). At the end of John Wick 3 it sets up a film that I honestly thought that John Wick 2 had set up - it's a fun ride but it feels like it went back to where we started.John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum delivers yet another cavalcade of headshots and beautifully choreographed action set pieces that are among the greatest in modern action cinema. Any fan of action cinema will not be disappointed in spending 2-hours sitting back and having Wick showcase just why he is so feared. The only letdown is that it doesn't conclude the promised \"trilogy\" but rather sets up another film - a film that I suspect every Wick fan will see opening weekend in a few years. In a way John Wick 3 is the Avengers: Infinity War of the Wick universe, and we all know how amazing Endgame turned out to be...",

        "text": "The man. The myth. The legend. Will somebody please, get this man a: pistol, shotgun, throwing knife, belt, sword, book, motorcycle and a horse. Because in a year of lacklustre releases, John Wick has come to save the day yet again. Oh yes! Being declared \"excommunicado\" results in a barrage of relentless well-choreographed action sequences that rivals its predecessors and action milestones such as 'The Raid 2', whilst also providing an in depth exploration of the assassin world that he resides in. Stahelski's franchise, from a revenge thriller to action extravaganza, has progressed substantially. For the better, might I add. Immediately after the events of the second film, John Wick is on the run from an endless wave of assassins after a ludicrously rewarding contract is put on his head.He has overcome vengeance, broken the rules of The Continental and is now succumbing to desperation. The clock is ticking. The assassins are preparing. Ready yourself for one of the best first acts this year (or any year for that matter!). Stahelski immediately injects his neo-noir aesthetic within the immediate second of John Wick running for his life. Vivid neon lights refracting from the harsh rainfall. The suspicious activity of passersby. Six o'clock hits. Showtime! The sheer ferocity of violence welcomes Mr. Wick as he is sublimely throwing daggers into skulls, destroying a jaw with just a book and politely using a horse to kick the absolute excrement out of others. Ooh. Aah. Ouch!Stahelski's signature eye for stunt work is unparalleled. Exhilarating long takes showcasing Reeves' physical prowess as he throws himself into every exciting sequence. Utilising various different pieces of equipment to inventively slay the opposition. An absurd amount of bone-crunching, skull-mashing and eye-popping that is enhanced due to the brilliant sound effects team. Even the gunshots made me clinch my chest, fooling me into thinking a bullet penetrated my heart. A refreshing sequence involving Berry's Sofia, an assassin who must help Wick, proves that Stahelski can balance multiple characters in the same action sequence. This also includes two vicious dogs that tear the enemy apart. A symphony of violence, where every component comes together perfectly.Both Reeves and Berry give physically demanding performances, with the former looking exhausted by the third act (a subtle detail I really appreciated), whilst also presenting a nuanced set of emotions. We all know Reeves is no Day-Lewis, and the writers avoid the sentimental moments for a more angered approach instead, working in his favour. A plethora of other characters, ranging from assassins to members of the High Table, are well introduced and remained memorable throughout.Is the third instalment perfect? Unfortunately not. Naturally in an action film, there are down times where the story simmers and allows the audience to catch a breath. These moments lulled too much in my opinion, considering the extensive runtime, and should've been shortened to keep the pace tighter. A sequence involving John Wick traversing a desert seemingly paused the film for a somewhat unusual part of the story that felt out of place. Then there's the ending. You're either on board with it or not, especially the plausibility of a certain fall. For me, I'm more inclined to tilt towards the former but understandably it will divide viewers. Occasionally the CGI can be noticeable, and will take you out of the action for the minuscule of seconds. However admittedly I'm nitpicking here.John Wick has to be one of the most consistent franchises available. Each instalment attempts to increase the carnage and stunt work. And it works. Whilst the lengthy runtime is questionable in places, Stahelski's third chapter is definitely \"preparing for war\" and I cannot wait to see how the story progresses. Reeves is the man. But John Wick is the hero!",

        "text": "It's very interesting to see this film that started off as a simple gun-fu action flick has spawned two sequels under its belt. I did like the second one, but felt that it lacked a few things that I loved about the first film. With this third entry, I do have to say that this may be better than the previous film and delivers a whole bunch of great moments that I simply enjoyed to witness. As this continues exactly where it was left off, you see John Wick trying to escape and I thought the film didn't disappoint. I'm still invested in this world of assassins and I liked seeing some of the returning characters. Just like how he was in the previous films, Keanu Reeves shows more of his acton chops than his acting ones. However, he is still entertaining to watch and I'm amazed with the stuff he did here. Despite that, I enjoyed the rest of the cast. Ian McShane is still cool as ever and I really liked how over the top Laurence Fishburne was.Personally, I thought that the pacing was much better here compared to its predecessor. Loved the first act as tensions were high and just watching John Wick trying to escape was very entertaining. With time ticking, I gripped my hands, just wondering how he would escape and how the film delivers the actions sequences here was absolutely amazing. The second act does slow down a bit and it is provided as a breather, but it doesn't slow down one bit and it still provides the entertainment. This is where we are introduced to some of the new characters, understanding more of the lore and rules that are followed in this world and we get to know more of John Wick's background. I liked the addition of Halle Berry here as with the amount of screen time she has here, I was interested in her character and when it came to her time to shine, she really delivered. She was so cool in this film and watching her shoot down a lot of baddies and kicking a whole bunch of butt was fun. With the final act, you get the full on action sequences that has a bit of good humor sprinkled throughout these fights. It lacked the overall tension in the first act, but I still had a blast and was fully entertained with all of the shootings and fist fights. With great choreography, setting and kills, there were several moments that did have me squirming and just react as if I was watching a pro-wrestling match.The story is still lacking as this is a full on action flick, but with how everything played out, I rather enjoyed this adventure and really liked how everything played out. However, saying that I did have a few gripes toward the overall movie. With some of the new characters, they come and go so quickly to the point that it had me wondering what other purpose do they have in this movie. Maybe they will be added to the sequel, if it gets made, but with who we were introduced to, I felt that the subplots with them could have been woven together with the plot more carefully to make it a better film. Technically, there is no plot and I understand that this film is simply made to show off some very cool action. However, by having a bit more plot and providing more depth to the characters, it would make it stand on its feet more and allow more opportunities to expand the franchise. And yet, maybe I'm just looking way too seriously into this film.But still, this is a great action flick and surprisingly still holds its ground. I do look forward to see what they do next and really had fun watching this film.",

        "text": "...which is not saying much. The first John Wick movie was a compelling, satisfying revenge flick with exciting action scenes, an interesting back story about Wick and the Continental Hotel, sympathetic heroes, well-defined villains, and some characters whose actions were mysterious but later revealed. The film had a tidy ending and didn't seem destined for a franchise.But the film was a big hit at the box office, and the Blu-Ray sales (back when BluRay sales will still popular...) even bigger. So Chapter 2 came along, which pit Wick against...nearly everyone in the movie! Laurence Fishburne was brought in to reunite with his former Matrix co-star, and his character's motives were just as fuzzy as the rest of them (he returns in Chapter 3). At one point, just about everyone lining the streets of Manhattan were sent there to take Wick out. Chapter 2 was more of an X-Box game than a movie, but it was more successful at the box office than the original, so...Chapter 3, one notch better than the first sequel because certain characters, as well as the group that controls the Continental Hotel (and the seemingly never-ending assassins), are explained...kind of. They appear to be an Illuminati-like secret group with an operation center sending out various assassination orders by agents covered in tattoos and gothic piercings. And the manager and head concierge are given more attention this time. At one point, the film travels to Casablanca, for no other reason, apparently, than unite Wick with second-billed Halle Berry. Her character? Don't expect the movie to explain her.So the X-Box fights are elevated to 11, and the formerly forbidden (as a center of action) Continental Hotel is now open for action. Wick and his foes continually crash into glass display cases, and there is a foe around every corner.Ultimately, the movie is a lead up to Chapter 4, and apparently a TV series as well. There are certainly better things to do (and things to watch) than this 2 hour and 10 minute stinker, but it's mostly so bad you can't help but watch it.",

It doesn't help that the action this time around isn't that good. It is choreographed well enough and impressive in some areas, but a middle aged female character taking down much bigger men with relatively feeble moves simply isn't convincing. Take away the motivating mechanism, and it's even less so. All that's left then is a movie that is a grind to watch.",

I loved the horse kick battles, the knife-throwing bonanza, the dogs used as spear, the library kill, and to be hones the film was very very brutal in some fights. I love brutality in action movies. But I can say that these things did not make the movie great like the first two parts.The fistfight scenes were incredibly prolonged, boring at times and at times I just wanted the fight to end, especially at the end of the movie. The villains in Parabellum were boring, dull and it looked like the actors didn't care about their characters. Keanu Reeves' acting was not good too. The plot-twist at the end was soo predictable and just for the sake of moving the plot to future parts, that i didn't care at all about it. John Wick is totally unkillable in this one, and the whole thing where he kills a thousand people and gets stabbed, shot, fall flat from the 100th floor and surviving is just becoming a parody and I think I can't take it anymore.I was excited for this part, but this is the last time. I don't want 4th part, just stop it! But who cares about what one person wants. The cash cow is ready to give its milk, so maybe they will never stop, as long as there are people who go to theaters hoping to see something different, but I think the hope is lost with Part 3...",

The editing along with the stylistic screenplay tailored to what makes a Keanu movie \"Keanu'esque\" which makes his fans enjoy his movies is a formula, I believe, has been thoroughly perfected by the John Wick Franchise. Special praise here for Derek Kolstad who wrote the screenplay (I believe with two other writers?). What may be well known is that Kolstad wrote the script for John Wick (little trivia: the title character is named after Kolstad's grandfather, which Keanu suggested) The choreography of the fight sequences - man! Keanu nails it. Even though most look like straight out of graphic novels, its polished and sharp. I was so glad to see Halle Berry (its been a while since I last saw her in a movie) but man! She's still got it in her! Just like Keanu, Halle too appears ageless!! She's superb and amazing in this movie - loved her action sequences. Keanu was a revelation! He carries off that detached wryness with a zen-like poise that's his trademark signature with an unmistakably effortless style. I personally feel John Wick 3 is the best in the series, I liked it more than the previous two. So for which, I feel this movie definitely deserves a full ten stars!!",

He loves Martial Arts and you can see the discipline he's put into this character I was blown away with action and fight scenes. The horse, the motorbike scene you knew it was a matter of time before we seen John Wick on a bike, if you've ever watched Keanu talk about bikes, talk about his own Motorbike company yes he owns his own Motorbike company he is like a big kid his eyes light up and a big grin goes across his face. When someone puts so much into preparing for a role it shows and this was insane. I loved it Halle Berry kicked arse too with the fight scenes her training paid off big. You could put these films on a shelve in the same category as the Bruce Lee films and it won't look out of place it belongs.",

        "rating": 10,
        "date": "2019-06-05",
        "text": "When we last saw John Wick he had an hour until his contract goes active. He 86'd a member of the assassins' High Table on Continental Hotel property. A code violation. The price is $14 million and everyone wants a piece of him. In a beautifully choreographed and filmed work directed by Chad Stahelski, New York at night looks stunning. And thankfully the traffic is stationary so we get to see Keanu Reeves taking on all comers with a poetic motion. Unlike the Marvel comic book CGI that is so fast you cannot actually see the action, Keanu means 'cool breeze over the mountains' and his John Wick is as fresh as ever. And Parabellum is preparing for war.But in John Wick - Parabellum, John isn't the only one with a bounty, and there is hell to pay for those who have helped him, retribution for disobedience to The High Table. And The Adjudicator, played by the nattily dressed Asia Kate Dillon, has come to collect. Kudos to costume design by Luca Mosca. And here was me thinking this was all about fair play, and The Adjudicator was here to make sure it was. Although John Wick against the world's assassins? I'll take that bet.Of course some of our assassins want to jump the gun and take John out before his hour is up. Bad sportsmanship, although there's no checking his book out of the New York Public Library, it goes straight to the throat. But when he's injured, honest to god the man is made of metal (even when he's shot in the heart), he has a few minutes to get stitched up by Doc, played by Randall Duk Kim. John does the decent thing and shoots him, after he finishes his own running stitches, just in case anyone thinks Doc treated him after the hour is up. He's pretty accurate.Sending his dog with no name off to Lance Reddick's Charon at the Continental, he'll pay later, John is now in play, and he's looking for a way out. You'll lose count of how many bodies he stacks up with (antique) flying daggers, all fair game though, and finds his way to Anjelica Houston's The Director. Watch out for a young ballerina peeling off her big toe nail, that's the gruesome part. Ballet isn't pretty off stage. But art is pain and life is suffering, scary Angelica growls. But she grants John safe passage to Morocco for family, and old times sake. Yeah she'll pay for that too.Some of the Casablanca locals didn't get the message of safe passage, but John eventually gets to the gorgeous Halle Berry. Her Sofia is running the local Continental Hotel for The High Table, but she's willing to settle a debt with John, and maybe score one of her own. Sofia is a better role than the Ginger Ale that Halle played in the terrible Kingsman: The Golden Circle, and she has a pair of really well trained dogs. They have their eyes always on the balls. How did she train them I wondered.Of course back in John's life there was a wife, and he wants to live to remember Helen, so he needs to get his contract cancelled. Only Saïd Taghmaoui's Elder of The High Table can cancel the debt. And his price is high. I thought there's no way that John is going to accept, but what choice does he have? So he's back to New York and the Continental Hotel.Meanwhile The Adjudicator hasn't been tardy in her cleaning up, she takes down the Bowery King for helping John. Laurence Fishburne's demise was a surprise and his punisher is Mark Dacascos's Zero. He will serve, and makes easy work of sushi, let's call it 7 cuts. And The Adjudicator also thinks that Ian McShane's Winston was a little too helpful to John when he gave him an hour head start. So Winston gets The High Table P45. He'll think about it. Think fast Winston, your card is marked and he's coming.Zero and his students are giddy with excitement at the thought of fighting the great John Wick. An Honour. To be honest John doesn't look like he's slept a wink so it hardly seems fair that they are all going to try and take him down, well them and two bus loads of armour plated hitmen. The Continental Hotel is 'deconsecrated' and killing on the property now allowed. In the library the glass cases look to be filled with beautiful Damien Hurst 'For the Love Of God' diamond skulls. The hardest mineral takes on the hardest man. John and Charon saddle up, although I wondered if Keanu had been too long in the saddle already?, choose your weapon, and when we call a parley, well there's your John Wick 4.What a buzz, Keanu has kept my interest since the first John Wick. Then it was a designer's dream with stunning home and New York architecture, now the dirty streets have eyes and everyone is a would be killer. It's lost none of its style though with Production Design by Kevin Kavanaugh. But there's humour on the side, those horses are fantastic, and every kick lands with a thump or kerpow. The fight scenes are masterpieces with a cracking team of stunt men and martial artists. Long may they have work of this quality to die with. And the ballet scenes were the icing on the cake for me, not normally associated with hard men, but when I did Chinese kickboxing they worked together well. And hopefully you can see the beauty with those flying kicks.A belter from Chad Stahelski with cinematography by Dan Laustsen, and of course some pretty good CGI. Those axes look bloody sharp when they land in someone's head!I loved it, see you summer 2021 for John Wick 4.",

It's just John Wick getting chased by the high table with a bounty of millions on his head. Lots of cool action scenes but some were just silly, particulary the stunts with him on the motorcycle killing the bad guys. Hallie Berry is laughable as the tough killer, should have got someone better. I liked the character of the Adjudicator, she had the perfect attitude. Eventually, Wick gets to meet the guy over the high table and he wants him to kill Winston. Wick agrees but upon meeting Winston again, changes his mind. So the Intercontinental loses its protection and we get a lot of gun and long sword fights at the end. You have to admit they are well choreigraphed.FINAL VERDICT: Good for what it is, but they need to come up with a story if they are going to continue to make sequels.",

        "text": "There may be a point when martial art, continuous movie violence, and stunt action on film becomes almost an overdone video game instead of an artful movie. With this third iteration, Keanu Reeve's seems to have relied almost too heavily on a stunt director who is unable to maintain a consistent, reliable movie fantasy tone as better accomplished by Aleksander Bach's Hitman: Agent 47 (2015) or Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003). There were several scenes where it appeared that John Wick somehow avoided being killed because the stunt action either goofed or the script attempted to be just too coy and cute allowing John to escape certain death. There were several scenes where the assassins that John encountered significantly became less adept at fighting from their earlier appearances or as in one scene with motorcycles, while John was permitted to use a gun, his opponents were oddly restricted to only using swords. In a strangely predictable twist towards the end, the movie plot outline seemed to attempt to please a larger audience incorporating both hardcore nasty shocking character denouements while also providing for a more pleasant audience experience which only seemed to result in a lazy compromise in scriptwriting. There are a number of nice tender, emotive points in the movie and a modicum of expressive qualitative moments, but overall, this action movie doesn't quite have the same depth and integrity as the previous two Wick movies. This third Wick movie had the basic outline for a really creative and powerful action movie, but it took the easier video game approach interspersed with a few human moments and overly cute inserts.",

Halle Berry is cool in this movie but why is she using the same moves as Wick? She could have had her own unique style that would have been great, instead her character reduces the Wick character because his moves become less HIS moves.Totally great movie but I will be interested in a fourth to see if they realise that the action is great but the Wick character is greater?",

        "text": "As a huge fan of the first two movies I came into this one with high expectations.\nWhat drawn me into this franchise particularly was the apparent realism of the fight scenes. They were extremely fast paced, the enemies would use guns when they could and attack when they could, and John would use the gun virtually all the time at a breathtaking pace to repel those hordes. However, something happened to the director in this movie. The action scenes are just horrible - John routinely finds himself without a gun, disarms enemies barehanded, but instead of taking their guns remains barehanded. Enemies with guns CHARGE John (so he can disarm them) instead of just shooting him from a distance. Enemies with guns charge blindly out of cover into an area where people are shooting RIGHT NOW, to get mowed down by John. Enemies choose swords and knifes instead of guns. But most annoying - enemies WAIT to attack the main character. Enemies with guns wait and wait until he shoots them instead of just shooting him. Enemies in hand combat wait until he's done with another enemy to attack him. This is SO apparent that it completely ruined the fun for me. Sure, most of the time they do so off-screen, but even then I kept thinking \"come on, he barely slapped him, what's he doing for the past 5 seconds?!?\" and sure enough he comes charging in after those 5 seconds, fresh as a cucumber. But even on-screen there are plenty of opportunities where the enemies just sit there in a chokehold doing absolutely nothing while Keanu tends to other enemies - not trying to stab him, or break free, just resting there. Plenty of punches don't connect in an embarrassingly obvious way.\nIn addition to that, the plot is non-existent, the blood is obviously done in CGI, and often times obviously poorly, and Keanu looked old and tired to me - he just didn't cut it as a super-assasin. His movements were slow and strained. He ran like an old guy. At one point he's seen without a shirt - a pasty middle-aged dude with not a muscle in sight.",

Picking up moments after his ex-communication (& with minutes to spare), Wick must call on some favors (one from a Russian mob leader played by Angelica Huston & another from Halle Berry, a woman he did a favor for) in order to skip town before everyone & their mother collects the 14 million & counting bounty to kill him. Meanwhile an adjudicator (played by Asia Kate Dillon) arrives in town to mete out justice to the entities which provided Wick w/help; Ian McShane's hotel owner & Laurence Fishburne, the Bowery King) whom she gives a week's time to settle their affairs before an Japanese enforcer (Mark Dacascos) settles their affairs for them. Employing every manner of firearm imaginable, goons are dispatched like the mail w/the requisite violence & gore at a maximum. If done right this series can pretty much go on until Reeves becomes uninterested or God forbid he dies while filming a particularly dangerous stunt but these films (really inspired by the Donald Westlake Parker novels where the hierarchy of organized crime is run like a business only to have one of their own call foul when their activities involve him), Wick is the last honest man in a world of dishonest men trying to maintain some dignity while meting out his own brand of final retribution.

I need more of Halle Berry and her dogs, please. The title character still gives one word answers and shoots people in the head stylishly, which honestly is why most of us watch this series.What doesn't work as well is when the movie slows down for worldbuilding and plot development. There's a cool story of survival here, but it's too simple to necessitate all the back story and peripheral information that we're present via exposition. Chapter 2 also suffered from this, while the first movie in the series seemed to clue us into the rules of this world and how it operates without taking some many frequent breaks to have someone explain it for our benefit (shooting the movie's momentum in the head in the process).Overall, I was entertained and I'm here for any new John Wick movies that come down the pipeline.",

When the action picks up again the fights seem to go on way too long, and are very repetitive. Some of the long fights at the end are amazingly choreographed though. I will say this as, I hated it when in a fight the guy(s) can kill John they stop and give him another chance to kill them (not die) it happens several times. I also hated that at one point John basically begs for his life - John bows to no man who threatens him. In the first two movies the fights are exaggerated but have a strong sense of realism to them (that's what makes them awesome), this movie (in the end fights) begins to slide towards the ridiculous. I think this franchise should've ended here, got a real feeling the writers are trying to squeeze out more than they should from this storyline. Definitely my least favorite of the three, I think the forth one will not be any better.",

There are few fast cuts here, John Wick 3 favors long and lingering shots following it's protagonist's violent sprees. Rather than being all cut to hell so you can barely tell what's going on, John Wick savor's every vicious movement and clash. It's something I started to appreciate earlier this year when I saw Alita: Battle Angel do something similar with it's fight sequences, but done with visceral relish here. Occasionally those sequences can be a bit drawn out to the point were it feels a bit monotonous, one part in the middle featuring Halle Berry's character was testing my patience a bit, but on the whole the film strikes the right balance.If you enjoy action and spectacle, John Wick 3 is a must see.",

        "text": "The latest installment of the JOHN WICK story (titled CHAPTER 3 - PARABELLUM) is one long chase scene. It's 2 hours and 10 minutes of John Wick (Keanu Reeves) running and fighting and chasing and fighting and running again and fighting again.And...that's just fine with me. For JOHN WICK 3 (JW3 as I'll call it from now on) is one of the finest choreographed films (fight scene-wise) that I have seen in quite a long time.Picking up right after JOHN WICK CHAPTER 2 - JW3 follows John as he is declared \"Ex-Communicado\" from the underground Assassins organization that he has been a part of, then retired from, then pulled back in with a $14 million bounty on his head.This flick kicks right into action (literally) with John and a few \"red-shirt assassins\" taking on each other in a hallway filled with knives. Will all these knives be used in the ensuing fight? You bet they will be - but it is how they are used - and how this scene (and all the fight scenes) are set-up, choreographed, and shot that makes this movie a strong cut above the standard fare in this sort of film.That's because Director Chad Stahelski - a stunt man/fight coordinator for over 70 films - wisely focuses his attention on the grace, athleticism and strength of the stunts/fights and eschews the \"quick-cut edit\" style of fight scenes that is so en vogue these days. Stahelski keeps his camera \"in place\" and lets us, the audience, watch what's going on in (seemingly) long shots that are going to have you saying to yourself \"how did they do that\". Stahelski has helmed all 3 John Wick films thus far and I hope he helms many, many more.You'll also be asking yourself how did 53 year old Keanu Reeves do all that fight work? It is incredible, physical work for him - and he is up to the task. John Wick is a man of few words - and much, much action - which suits the acting talents of this performer quite well.Back for another go in the series - and having fun along the way - are Ian McShane, Lawrence Fishburne and Lance Reddick - as colleagues, collaborators and/or foes of John Wick in this underworld. Capably joining in - with just as much a twinkle in their eyes - are Angelica Huston, Hallee Berry (in her best work in years) and Jerome Flynn (Bron from Game of Thrones). A new addition (at least to me) was the strong work brought forth by Asia Kate Dillon (TV's ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK) as \"the Adjudicator\" - who is monitoring the John Wick proceedings, Special mention needs to be made of the work of Mark Dacascos (TV's Iron Chef America!) as Wick's chief adversary - a strong effort (both acting-wise and physically/fighting wise) that I just didn't know this performer had in him.A quick side-note on some animal performances here. There is a scene where a bad guy \"gets it\" from a horse...and I thought...how are they going to top that...and then immediately top it - GOOD FOR YOU, HORSE! And...a film has FINALLY figured out a way to use attack/guard dogs in a way that had you rooting for these four-legged, furry friends over the fiends they are attacking.But...make no mistake about this...this film is about the fighting...and the intriguing Assassin's world that was first presented in the original (and I do mean ORIGINAL) John Wick film. I said at the time that I hoped they would expand this world, I wanted to see more of it. And...expand it they have...for the better. The world has become more intriguing to me, and I want EVEN MORE, PLEASE, of this world and of the uniquely original fight choreography that comes along with it.This film is not for everyone - it is bloody (but in a \"cartoon way\"...I wouldn't say it is gory) and it is one long chase scene. But, if this is \"your thing\", you'll enjoy it very much.Letter Grade: A-8 stars out of 10 and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",

        "text": "In general, hyper-violent is not my style of film. What makes John Wick entertaining is that the character has humility.Enter Sofia (Halle Berry) and The Adjudicator (Asia Dillon). Huge egos, weak acting and not an ounce of humility. At one point, Sofia sees Wick is dehydrated so she spits in a bottle and gives it to him to drink. That's probably the lowest point in Berry's career (even worse than being caught lying about her high scool prom). If the goal was to make a highly unlikeable 'hero', it worked.Solid performances from Keanu Reeves and Ian McShane (who thankfully varied his role of one-dimensional villain that he plays in many other roles).The action scenes are superbly choreographed, except they are too long at times. Some of the fight scenes have excellent humour (which was necessary to offset Berry and Dillon's appalling performances). Don't get me wrong, Berry's action sequences were extremely well done, but, they were offset by her weak acting and huge ego.Lawrence Fishburne is reasonable in this movie. At times, Fishburne can be extremely egotistical. However, he pales in comparison to Berry and Dillon who took ego to a whole new level.Lance Reddick (as Cheron) is the epitome of cool. However, the best performance by far in the movie goes to Mark Dacascos as Zero, who plays the first superb ninja-like character i've seen in the last decade. He plays humble, hilarious and agile superbly. The other \"ninja warriors\" of Hollywood could learn much from Mr Dacascos' performance.TL, DR - Berry and Dillon's performances sucked. Action overall excellent, Dacascos steals the show thanks to a combination of humility and agility (almost never seen in Hollywood these days).5/10 because of unnecessary political correctness, awful performances from Berry, Dillon (and Berry's dogs) and giving Angelica Huston such a laughable role.",

But this third entry again sees Keanu Reeves sleep walking his way through a movie.I can't deny that there was at least some decent action amongst the ridiculously high body count. A majority of the film though was the same repetitive fighting 1 bad guy at a time with guns I remember boring me In the first movie. Only more so.The Biggest problem though is that there is NO STORY. Add to that some really dumb stuff (The CGI effect used to make Keanu and others \"disapear\" into the crowd like Batman is the dumbest) some crinchy dialogue and a eye rolling sequel promising ending, and i really can't recommend this.",

Keanu Reeves again takes the lead role of John Wick and it is a character he's perfectly suited to.The plot and writing play second fiddle to the action sequences. For those people who enjoy action movies this will be rich entertainment. There is no doubt that many of the scenes are thrilling action sequences that are occasionally jaw dropping.Personally I find many of the action sequences pretty hard to follow and it is not really my favourite genre of film. Having said that there's barely time to draw breath and the 2 hours running time quickly flashes by. If you are into action movies and/or Keanu Reeves you'll love this one.",

As you might expect, the action part is the one that counts, featuring countless fights, shooting and spectacular moves which makes it a delight to watch, if you're into this type of movies like I am. The main characters do their job very well, helped of course by the plot which is good, and keep the viewer interested the entire time. It's not predictable, it's not boring and it's not without a couple of twists to spice things up from time to time.To point out some less awesome aspects of this film, I have to remark the exaggerations in the overall combat scenes. I know it's based on exaggerations but this time it feels they've gone a bit too far with them. It isn't something that can bother but their there to be found if you pay close attention. Another aspect might be the plot itself. As I said before, it's good and it does its job well, but I felt that it could have had a bit more substance, which would have brought it closer to the first movie's.Overall, I can say that I found what I was looking for. A great action movie which delivers plenty of drama and suspense, impresses with its fighting and shooting sequences thanks to some remarkable scenes but also thanks to some great actors who've done their job once again very well in making it all a great watch.",

John Wick 2 bored us with cheesy dialogue and repetitive gun-play. John Wick 3 redeems itself both in scale and variety.Let's start with the set pieces. John Wick 1 & 2 were heavy in the dark, neon-lit places of the underworld. Parabellum expands on this world and brings him out into the light.Loved the creative direction they went with this film.Right from the beginning, we're introduced into some unorthodox action. Yet, not all is action and rough one-liners. Some humor is added into this film, breaking up the monotony.And those fighting styles! Before watching this, I thought I was going to be bored with an hour and a half of pure gun-play. Parabellum impresses us with a variety of different fighting styles and weapons. From the use of hand-to-hand, belts, horses, books, and even dogs in combat, Parabellum stands out. Pretty much all the fighting sequences is over-the-top and impressive. There is something new around every corner of this movie. Add in the fact that Keanu Reeves is doing all his own stunts solidifies his status as an action hero staple.But not all is well. There are a few points that ruined my suspension of belief.For starters, civilians don't seem to react to anything going around them. People are killed left and right and even in some of the most public places in the world. Gun shots ring throughout the city, yet no one calls a single police officer. Crazy over-the-top gun fighting and car chases are occurring on the streets and no one seems to notice. Not like NYC is a major city or anything (/sarcasm).Then there are the characters. We see some impressive new characters but they disappear as fast as they are introduced. There was some room for character development that was skipped for sake of the action and time. Such a shame and I hope that the next installment resolves some of this.There are also some improbable and lucky spots that allows John to survive. I get it that he's a master assassin, but he's not a superman invincible to the same laws of physics that bind us all.Oh well, I hope JW4 continues the upward trajectory of the series.3.5/5. A better improvement over the 2nd installment, but not as good as the original.",

        "text": "After the events in the previous film protagonist John Wick has been declared excommunicado for killing a member of the 'High Table'. This means all other members of the organisation are forbidden from aiding him and there is a price on his head... $14,000,000! Luckily he has a couple of debts to call in so manages to get out of New York and into Casablanca. Here he sets about finding The Elder, the leader of the organisation to plea to be allowed to live. When he finds him he is told the price of his life will be high. Meanwhile an 'adjudicator' turns up in New York to punish Winston, the manager of the New York Continental, and the 'Bowery King' for helping John.If you are a fan of full on action with only a relatively simple plot then the 'John Wick' films are just the thing. No time is wasted telling the viewer what happened before this film starts so I'd definitely recommend watching the previous two films first. If you do go into this without seeing the previous instalments you'll soon figure out that it is basically John Wick and a handful of friends versus everybody else. The action starts quickly and apart from a couple of pauses to advance the plot continues till the credits roll. The action is nicely varied with shooting, knife-fighting, sword-fighting and hand to hand combat... not to mention two attack dogs with a propensity for biting their owner's enemies in the groin! Keanu Reeves really impresses as our eponymous anti-hero and the rest of the cast is solid too. Special mention must be given to all the stuntmen; their characters may be nameless goons only in the film for a few seconds before getting dispatched but they make the viewer believe the over-the-top action. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of action films; do be warned though if you are offended by on-screen violence you certainly won't like this. I can't wait for Chapter Four.",

It went against certain action film conventions - the hero was not a muscle bound hulk like a Schwarzenegger or Stallone, the action was super fast paced, the plot was basic and straighforward, but introduced some unique elements, and there was something a bit unique and stylish about the film. John Wick was cool.Then they made a sequel. And while the second film was more ridiculous, less believable, and not as good on any level, it was still John Wick, and still enjoyable.But this third film is out of ideas and is simply rehashing the same things again for a payday (and hey, people seem to like it, so I can't fault them entirely). The magic is gone and it's just another over the top action film. In their attempt to mine more movies out of what was the barest of bare bones plots to start with, they have had to resort to ever increasing gratuitous violence and fight scene gimmicks. I'm no wilting rose, but even I was a bit unsettled by the casual nature of the violence in this film, which surely has one the highest body counts of any film in recent history. It was so over the top it became a bit cartoonish, like watching a video game. There was even the concept of John fighting a series of progressively more important and more difficult \"bosses,\" just like a video game. John Wick 3 is watchable.... but barely.",

        "text": "So far the John Wick franchise has been consistently good. The main selling point is the action and none of them fail to deliver. However, I think it's time to put more focus on the story for the coming sequels.John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum continues from the end of Chapter 2 where John Wick becomes the target of assassins all over the world after a $14 million bounty is put on his head.Where this film succeeds is the action. There is a lot spread across the entire film, all of which are extremely well choreographed and shot. I loved how each action sequence was different from the rest. It managed to stop the action becoming tedious at any point. As soon as the film started there was this instant intensity and uncertainty regarding the fate of John Wick which kept me constantly invested in the film.Like the second film, this movie also expands on the John Wick universe as we meet new characters from the likes of Halle Berry and Anjelica Huston. Both of which do an incredible job as their roles. We also see people from The Raid films and watching Keanu Reeves fight against them felt really exhilarating. Recurring actors like Ian McShane and Lance Riddick also create a good impression once again.My main complaint since the second film was how weak and unbelievable the storyline felt. There were times where people would get killed in public and no one would react suggesting that everyone there were assassins which did not feel believable at all. There was also a moment which could have added a good amount of development to John Wick's character but it was not explored enough. Whilst the action was fun to watch, there were moments where I felt the assassins could have easily killed John Wick as they were overpowering him but chose not to.Despite the weak plot, John Wick 3 is still a good installment in the franchise as it contains some of the best action I've ever seen in a film. It would better if they could build upon the story for the next film.",

        "text": "When you think of action stars on the planet one of those first three names should be thought of is Keanu Reeves. The man has made some of the most influential action films of all time. If it was for Point Break we would not have The Fast & Furious franchise. Without The Matrix, who knows what action movies would have looked like for the last 20 years. I know without The Matrix we would have gotten the John Wick series and that would be a crime. Saying that I'm so hyped for the third chapter in this series is an understatement. This film is the second most anticipated film for me of 2019. But could all this hype I was giving it, could this film be exactly what I hoped and more? Yes, it could and it did.John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum (such a long name) starts off minutes after John Wick Chapter 2 ends. And if you haven't seen John Wick Chapter 2 then stop reading this review, go see that, go see Chapter 3 and then come back. Yes, they are that good, what are you doing here? Get going! John at the end of Chapter 2 had murdered a member of the high table on Continental ground. This is a criminal offense in this world and he had been excommunicated. He was no on the run with a high bounty on his head. Every assassin in the city would be hunting him down. This third chapter follows him as he tries to call in every favor that he has to stay alive. It takes him from NYC all over the world including meeting an \"old friend\" Sofia (Halle Berry) and getting a bit of his back story from a former mysterious instructor The Director (Anjelica Huston).But not only does John have to deal with his consequences from his actions, but his friends and acquaintances are also feeling the heat too. An adjudicator (Asia Kate Dillon) has set a time table for Winston (Ian McShane), Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne) for them to either step down or bow allegiance to the high table. It's a complicated mess John has gotten everyone into. Add to that there is an assassin named Zero (Mark Dacascos) working with the Adjudicator. It's a simple story but with a lot of moving parts. Some questions are left open but much of them are answered by the final credits roll.Chad Stahelski, director of the film, has made himself one of the premiere action directors working now. It's funny that his co-director on the first film David Leitch went on to big action films but Stahelski stayed in this world. And I don't want him leaving anytime soon. The action in this film is top notch. Keanu has once again outdone himself, bringing John to life in stunning fashion. We know the man can fight but the action scenes in this film are wild, to say the least. Without the sure effort of Reeves back by a good director in Stahelski there's no way these films would be half as entertaining as they are. The cast, everyone gets enough screen time to bring excellent characters to flesh out the film. Halle Berry's work is the best I've seen her in an action film. She is in the film less than I would have hoped but she can kick ass with the best of them.McShane gets some of the best lines in the film. Lance Reddick comes back as Charon but this time gets to get in on the action as well. Huston and Fishburne bring a cool gravitas that makes the film feel classy and sophisticated. Dacascos has most of the best comedic moments especially when he's on screen with Reeves. They play off of each other very well every though they are trying to kill each other. Asia Kate Dillon is fantastic as the Adjudicator. They have this power and fierceness to the character that you are rooting against but respect. One thing I have to totally commend the director and filmmakers for is the Adjudicator character is non-binary human played by a non-binary human. Being a pansexual male, I'm always looking for representation in film. Being a huge blockbuster film, it's wonderful to see good representations of the humans in society and onscreen.The action is what we all come for in these films and it never lets up. The opening 20 minutes will have any action fan screaming in joy and on the action of their seat. Stahelski went balls to the wall with this film. It gets a bit ridiculous but not enough to turn a filmgoer off. It's grounded enough that you would think most people trained enough could do this in the real world. We get chases, gun fu, hand to hand battles, sword battles, and more. It's so wild but so enthralling. All of the film is shot so everything is seen on screen. The action scenes are shown in wide shots and long takes. There is no quick cut editing here. We feel the brutality of the fights and the stunts. The actors and stunt people go through hell but it comes off so well on screen. I wish more of the big action films would train actors to fight instead of trying to fake with quick edits that make people dizzy. There is a sense of landscape in these action scenes, you know where everything is and how the environment looks. Which you can connect with the scenes no matter how crazy they are.Hands down John Wick: Chapter 3 Parabellum is the best action movie I've seen this year. Also, it's one of the best action movies I've seen in a while (maybe since Chapter 2). Keanu and the entire cast are excellent in this wild third ride. Chad Stahelski has proved himself once again he can tell a decent story in a great action movie. Everyone gets a good scene or two to show off their stuff but Keanu owns the film and proves this is one of the many reasons why I love this man onscreen. I'll have to see the film again but this might be my favorite film franchise of all time. Just my opinion. And I'd be happy to serve and will be of service if there is a decision to make a John Wick: Chapter 4.",

The second movie was not good like the first one but still entertaining.\nThe third part was soo boring in my eyes. A lot of action without any story. Shooting... fighting... shooting... fighting... no idea behind. The characters are handling stupid and i really do not understand why they are doing the things they are doing.\nDo not waste time in that movie. There are a lot of better movies and you really will not miss anything if you will not watch it.\nSorry for my bad english i did my best :p",

John Wick 2 had some problems but still overall was pretty solid.Now John Wick 3 starts exactly where part 2 ended and it did so pretty well. You can see the immediate pressure with the \"excommunicado\" right away. The first action scene also delivered what I'd expected from the movie which I really liked.However it then unfortunately slowly it started getting worse and worse. John Wick had such a thick plot armor due to constant dumb actions taken by his opponents that it wasn't even funny anymore. Towards the end I was really rolling my eyes because of the interactions between the characters during action sequences.There were various ridiculously cool moments in the movie just like in the previous ones but for me they couldn't save it overall. The plot tried to \"subvert my expectations\" but it did so in an unsatisfying way. And let's just say there are some characters that seriously deserved a bullet in the head...And with what I've seen now I'm not sure I want to see a John Wick 4.....which is a possibility....",

        "text": "It is nice to see Keanu Reeves launch a franchise on his own, with a fresh new mythology and familiar old faces. From the start, it seems the cinematographer wanted to make his own \"Blade Runner\" tribute. It is always dark and raining. Florescent lights line the walkways. The set design continues to become more textured each sequel. The story continues to add new mythology (rules of the game) with each outing as well. The new mythology actually builds a journey through Wick's past, as he connects with people from his past. Like a good graphic novel, this is very adult (in terms of violence) but very comic book in its reality. The way the 'rules' are laid out, it is a more advanced society of honor among thieves (or assassins).A little more conflict and world building includes the resistance to the 'High Table' by Winston, the manager of the Continental Hotel. Resistance also comes in the form of Laurence Fishburne, in which you can't help but think about Neo and Morpheus when they are together. The antagonist here is a snooty woman who is capable of laying judgement on our heroes with a simple phone call. Such is their orderly system of bounty hunting. Also on her side is an attention craving fighter that wants to be considered an equal to Wick. He is the designated big last bad guy that doesn't have any real scenes until the end of the 3rd act.Along the way, Wick finds safe harbor while being chased by fellow assassins by old chums who owe Wick a favour. Of these compadres, Angelica Huston steals the show as a ballet director who seems to take pleasure in torturing her dancers. These old chums are opportunities to add some additional scenic design, and makes for interesting world building as the franchise grows larger.Oh, then there is the action. I must admit I enjoy this kind of action only so much, and then it gets tedious. On the one hand, this franchise was built in inventive choreography when it comes to fighting scenes, both with weapons and without. So there is an intense kind of variable that is enjoyable, such as a fight taking place in front of large displays of knives. On the other hand, the extended fight sequences start to become less thrilling as they become more commonplace. Even with the addition of Halle Barry and some attack dogs, it seems to be an endless enigma, where there is always yet another higher-up person to find and kill.This franchise began with a fun alternate-world where everyone is basically a servant to the criminal overlords. The reverence to the 'rules' that everyone obeys over fear of the chaos that would ensue without them. This world is fun to see fleshed-out, and certainly must show some real expansion for the 4th outing.Overall, a franchise that relies heavily on the same type of physical action scenes, it has no justification to clock in over 2 hours, and the tedium set in as the third act dragged on. The filmmakers should remember their roots and keep the pacing slick and trim.",

The well thought action scenes is what continues to be the driving force, with sometimes up to 10+ mins scenes with pure asskicking. The humor is still one of the film's strong points, with a lot of witty comments from the characters through out its playtime. The characters, old and new, are just as interesting as in the previous titles. As we dig even deeper into the universe, from which Wick was molted by, we truly get an insight of just how powerful the organization is, and how long it stretches.All around a fantastic action film, that through well thought violence, slick humor, and interesting characters keeps you hooked all the way. I highly recommend it!",

The cinematography is slick and the visual effects vivid and punchy (no pun intended), but beneath this the film's plot is paper-thin. Parabellum leans heavily on the tropes utilised so far in the series, to the point where nearly every scene is a melange of gun and knife fights, with the usual artistically choreographed martial arts battle thrown in. All of this is stunning to watch, but after a while you find yourself becoming visually fatigued by it all. To put it another way, one feels Chad Stahelski has over egged the pudding.Keanu Reeves delivers his usually staid, one dimensional performance while Ian McShane (Winston) & Laurence Fishburne (the Bowery King) shine in their respective roles. It's also nice to see Lance Reddick (Charon) gain a bit more depth while Asia Kate Dillon is execllent in her role as the loathsome Adjudicator.While this current installment in the franchise is not as edgy, John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is nonetheless an entertaining, adrenaline soaked action thriller that perhaps stretches itself too far.The twist at the end of the film is a nice touch to keep moviegoers intrigued enough to stick with the endless bodycount going forward into Chapter 4.",

Parabellum, tells the story of how John is trying to keep himself alive after he's been \"excomunicado\", or whatever.His head is at a stake and the bid is high, but our friend Baba Yaga delivers. It's non-stop action to its finest! It's been a while since we had good \"heroes\" on cinema! Everything now is about superheroes and all that, I really missed this good old 90s hero stuff, like John McClaine or Riggs, for example, and Wick gives me this feeling back again.Of course, it is over the top stunt action, where our hero takes several damage and yet he is there fighting, but that's the way we like it.Also, I like this whole idea of a secret organization that runs underground, controlling everything and with its own rules about trust and yada-yada, that's nice. People like that, about the whole Illuminati stuff, that's a good deal for me.Sound-wise, nothing to see here, it's pretty much generic action music and a lot of shooting and stuff breaking. Stunts are good, but I guess it doesn't top its predecessor, although it is still good.Storywise, it's what we expects, with a lot a twists and turns, so everything is kept at an appreciating level.Good stuff.",

I didn't go into this movie expecting amazing character development, I wanted to see John Wick shoot a bunch of people in the head and that's what I got.I thought the visuals were amazing and it had some cool action scenes, but it was definitely lacking a lot of depth.The characters were boring and underdeveloped, the plot was shallow and lacked meaning, the pacing was off, the writing wasn't great, there were some flaws with the logic, and I feel like the whole thing just lacked emotion. So although there were a ton of flaws, those weren't the things I was expecting from the movie, it was strong in the areas I wanted it to be. I mean it's a goddamn John Wick film, who gives a crap about character development, he's riding horses and throwing people through glass houses that's pretty freaking awesome! It doesn't go deep, and I wasn't expecting it to. Overall I would say it's entertaining and pretty good for an action movie, but I would give it a 6/10 quite generously.",

        "text": "This is the third installment of the John Wick franchise and it promises us more to come, it really goes to show just what an amazing job Keanu Reeves and the entire team behind this franchise has created. Originally intended to be a one and done action revenge tale has grown into an expansive universe of assassins and contract killers. The continued exploration of this facet of the John Wick cinematic universe was one of the best parts of this movie, exploring the different factions and cogs that go into this whole underworld of assassins.John Wick also brought us the franchise's trademark action sequences filmed with minimal cuts to present us with that raw, meat on meat action that we are accustomed to expect in a John Wick movie. In many ways this movie is as expected, not bringing much surprises or twists but rather, building on expanding the intricacies of this fascinating world.John Wick as a franchise thrives in action and this expansive world building but centers around the core value of revenge and man's best friend. If you going into this movie expecting serious storytelling and intricately imbedded themes and symbolism, what are you doing at a John Wick film? However, I do think that if this franchise were to continue growing it must take a stronger focus on narrative because the wall to wall action is starting to have less and less of an impact. While so far the franchise has managed to reinvent its action it would be an interesting idea to explore deeper themes and grow beyond its original shell.",

There is a $14 Million bounty on his head. All other Assassins are on the job to end John Wick. John Wick now has no choice but to kill all who are after him. Winston (Ian McShane), the Manager of the hotel says, \"Everybody in this town wants a piece of him (John Wick). I'd say the odds are about even.\"This is probably the very best Action Movie ever. Not only do we see amazing fights and shootings with exceptional choreography we also see different and unique sets where all this takes place. I hope the motorcycle scenes are mostly CGI, otherwise: Ouch, Ouch, Ouch. I checked myself into the ER to make sure I was okay.There is a new wrinkle in that we see Asia Kate Dillon as the Adjudicator who is from the Assassin's High Table and she wants those who helped John Wick to leave their posts as they abdicated their loyalty to the High Table of Assassins. And, if they don't..........well, you know what will happen.Notables: Angelica Houston as The Director, who sends John Wick to Casablanca; Halle Berry as Sophia, a one time assassin, helps John Wick to see her former boss, Berrada (Jerome Flynn), who can get John Wick in to see the Elder (Said TAghmaoui), who can override John Wick's excommunication from the High Table and he gives John Wick a choice he must consider; Boban Marjanovic as Ernest, who fights John Wick (early on) in the library; Lance Reddick as Charon, the hotel's Concierge; and Mark Dacascos as Zero, the Chef, and the last one to fight John Wick in a glass room.The pacing was spot on. The music reminded me of running escape music. Really good. Keep in mind that John Wick is fighting for his life and many, many assassins come after him for the $14 million bounty. I had no idea there were that many assassins among the populace. Ya just never know.And we see Sofia's dogs engaged in the fighting, too, as John Wick and Sophia fight their way out of Berrada's house. These were very scary scenes with the dogs.Yes, there will be a sequel. Can't wait. (10/10)Violence: Yes.\nSex: No.\nNudity: No.\nHumor: At times.\nLanguage: Yes, mostly n the second half.\nRating: A",

Yes, every now and then we get a well balanced action movie with a story worth it's grain. But this is John Wick, plain and simple. Those expecting more from the formulae need to look elsewhere or stop watching the movies. With that being said. Fun, this movie is fun. Simple and straightforward plot, great action scenes, Uber violent in all the right ways. One more thing. Those asking for a role for Keanu to be an \"actor\" Keanu is many things and may be a lovely man, but a good actor, well!?!?",

        "text": "John's not having a good week.Let's recap: John's wife dies, she gifts him a dog from the grave, sadly said dog heads to the grave shortly after and John's car is stolen. John retires his retirement to exact revenge and eventually gets his car back. But, the commotion he caused sucks him back in to complete a mission, get targeted and exact revenge, once again. In doing so, he's ousted from the assassin's creed.And all that takes place over two movies and basically less than a week. Meanwhile, 30 minutes later...we have: John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum.I'm such a huge fan of the first one, I was skeptical and not wanting a sequel. It was a complete story and could've/should've been one and done. But, I watched the second chapter regardless and it was pretty good. Definitely a step down from #1, but worthy.Now I was nervous about the continual reduction of quality before I saw the third installment. In fact, I almost didn't see it in theatres, but decided to anyways. I AM....GLAD I DID.This movie was fantastic. As close to as great as the first one was, but just off a bit and a total redemption from part 2. The humor was stepped up, the action intense and the creativity was definitely alive. This was definitely John Wick's Last Crusade (make-up movie.)Like I said, he's got now 30 minutes before he's excommunicated, or is it excommunicado, or is that the same word, different language? Anyways, he has to fight his way out of trouble and try his best to stay alive. It ain't easy when no one wants to/can help him.I think the entire series (of 3 so far) has taken place in about a week or so. Nice to see Keanu Reeves look and act the same even though it's been years in-between the sequels. I never thought I'd ever say it, but he's amazing in this and it's his best series to date. (Yes, way better than The Matrix, and uh-huh, more excellent than Bill & Ted's.)If you had doubts like me about this movie, squash them right now, go online, buy a ticket and then go see it. Doesn't just help you to see the first 2 first, but it's practically a must. So, if you haven't, buy said ticket for tomorrow and binge Chapters 1-2 back-to-back and you'll be in for a real treat tomorrow.And what'll sweeten the pot: the terrible CGI blood that's so blatantly obvious in the first two films is just barely found here. More so in the last half, but at least they give you a full hour without dealing with such lazy filmmaking and cheap shortcuts.Cannot wait to buy this trilogy on blu when it comes out. Probably best action trilogy since Bourne's OG threesome.***Final thoughts: After more than a year's search, I finally, and swiftly, found a song I've been dying to find! This movie actually played it - totally shocking and pleasing me since I knew I could find it immediately upon returning home: \"Ninja Re Bang Bang.\" Since I don't speak Japanese and only heard 30 seconds of it from two friends (of each other) doing the TikTok thing to it, I had little to go on. I messaged the owner of the video and never heard back. So, thanks, John. Sorry, Mr. Wick. It took pure coincidence for me to hear that 2013 song in your 2019 action flick set nowhere near Japan.",

Some of the action sequences go on for so long that you start to wonder if they are ever going to end... And it's not just the \"more is better\" approach, they really came up with some creative ideas to up their game in this chapter. The time and energy that must have went into each scene is incredible! The visuals and each set are a work of art. Sequels usually get worse over time, but this franchise is determined to keep getting better (much like Mission Impossible). I usually can't give action movies that are this gratuitous such a high rating but Wick 3 earned it!",

Oh yes it is:\nWick(ed) will be served to you, and Wick(ed) will be at your service.The premise of the movie resides on two clean-cut rules and absolute categories:\n1. Follow the rules, or otherwise face the consequences (when referring to the system i.e. association of underground organizations)\n2. Love thy loved ones, and be ready to suffer for them (when referring to the values of oneself i.e., the main hero, John Wick).But, clean-cut rules work perfectly only in games and strategies.\nIn real life all is fair in love, and especially in war. In times of war, anything goes. And the absolute rules can result in catastrophic consequences from (somewhat) bizarre mistakes (like getting all fussed over a car scratch which is a reference to the second sequel). This becomes evident throughout the movie (not that the movie carried for plots and consistencies). And it is demonstrated in such a brutal, visceral, yet artful way. This Wick(ed) esthetics of binding together two contrasting categories (i.e., violence which can best be described as \"a beautiful mess\") evokes conflicting emotions. Those feelings will evoke lasting memories and this is guaranteed success for the billboards.",

The issue with this particular film is that the action is not as intense as it was in the first one, especially the climactic action sequence is not at all satisfying. Also, for some reason there are comedic elements in the film which were absent in the prequels, and rightfully so. There is no need for comedy in action films.I am awaiting the next one in the series and hope that it will be better than this one.",

        "text": "Just saw John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum and this helps make the John Wick trilogy one of the greatest action trilogies' of all time. John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum takes place right after the second movie where John Wick, played by Keanu Reeves, has killed a member of the high table and has a $14 million bounty on his head. Now he has to prove why everybody calls him baba yaga (boogeyman) as he fights to survive. First of all, I will say that this film has the best action scenes out of all three films. Not a lot of these scenes though had one shot takes but honestly I'm fine with that because they are still really entertaining to watch. I honestly have no clue how director, Chad Stahelski, can keep upping up these action shots but somehow he can and has. Keanu Reeves is still amazing as John Wick and just dominates it as this role. Although I didn't like what they did to his character that just comes out of nowhere and doesn't fit his character. I'm not the biggest fan of Halle Berry, who plays Sofia, but in this role she won me over. Especially because I learned that she actually did a lot of her stunts herself and went through the training. I will say that the middle section of this movie is really slow and pretty boring at times. During the middle section it slows down to a snail pace and it feels like it. It was at this point in time that I was considering lowering the review but then it redeemed itself with the finally. There is a subplot that ok I understand why it had to happen but in the end it wasn't really necessary and just came in at awkward times. The editing in this film was awkward and how it transitioned from one scene to the next. There was no smooth transition it just awkwardly changed scenes. The music in this film is still great though and if anybody needs and epic soundtrack to work out to this soundtrack is perfect for that. I do wish that in one scene they included music. In the end, John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is a great film for the first bit and ending but the middle section loses it for me. It does end with an idea for a fourth movie and I hope it will happen. I give John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum a 9.5/10.",

        "text": "NON-SPOILER REVIEW:Of all three John Wick films, Parabellum was definitely the most hyped up and anticipated one. A stronger marketing for the film as well as the general buzz that has been surrounding Reeves lately, I was definitely more excited for Parabellum than the previous two, both of which I am fans of.PROS +:\nLike the previous two films, Parabellum is visually stunning. The cinematography is on point and the action and choreography are definitely above standard with each punch and kick and bullet impact packing brutal force. Reeves continues his titular role as the elite hitman John Wick and fulfills it yet again. The acting from other characters overall isn't great but they get their job done in an action movie.Cons -:\nSince the first John Wick, the franchise has been on this slow decline to becoming your average action flick only the bonus is that it has Keanu Reeves. The first film was simple and kept it simple. It came in and did its job as an entertaining action film and ended sweet. I felt the second however, while still a good film, only convoluted and added layers to the overall story that didn't add anything interesting in my opinion. The overarching 'Assassin Order' type plot didn't work for me. Parabellum only expands on said plot. The franchise is becoming more like a first person shooter with long, overextended action sequences and an almost gimmicky storyline that feels tacked on to keep an excuse for the waves upon waves of enemies that are killed. The action is neverending while the story is never expanded upon in any meaningful or fulfilling way. With a fourth film planned and possibly no ending in sight for this franchise, they need to find some way to improve upon the story in my opinion while keeping the action fresh, otherwise the next film is going to be old with the same generic action. Neglecting the story will lead to meaningless action which while loved by many action fans, will leave those wanting an interesting plot of any kind disappointed.I love Keanu as much as the next person but please, don't let this franchise become the next *insert annual summer release action flick that is forgotten in a year*.6/10",

        "text": "Back when the original John Wick's trailer came out most people expected that it would just be your run of the mill revenge movie starring Keanu Reeves, just with a dog. But then it ended up being one of the best action movies of the past decade, showing us great fight sequences in film at a time when Liam Neeson was still learning how to jump over a fence in less than 15 different cuts. Then John Wick: Chapter 2 came out, further raising the bar with even more ambitious fight choreography and expanding on the world of assassins. Now John Wick 3 cements the franchise as one of the most consistently entertaining action trilogies.Starting less than an hour after the previous film, John Wick is on the run after after being given a 14 million dollar bounty on his head for killing one of the leaders of the assassins organisation, which every assassin wants a piece of. And it turns out there are a lot of assassins in the world, as no matter where Wick goes he's swarmed by opponents at every turn, including armored SWAT teams, the villains from the raid movies and the host of Iron Chef.In a film that's mostly non-stop action, it never gets dull or repetitive. In large part, this is because the filmmakers have a strong understanding on how to incorporate their surroundings into the film to add variety to these sequences. Largely this is because John Wick is able to improvise with using anything as a weapon, with John using knives, guns, motorbikes, dogs, books, his belt, horses and his own fists to keep each fight unique. Other times it's just a strong understanding of how to shoot the sequence to keep the sequences kinetic and visually interesting.At the centre of this is Keanu Reeves himself, who put months of training to pull off some of these unbelievable sequences. Though a lot of credit also has to go to everyone behind the scenes for pulling off so many ambitious sequences. Especially for one sequence which takes place in a room made almost entirely from glass which had me genuinely wondering how they were able to perform these sequences without anyone getting seriously injured.As with the previous two films, these brutally fight sequences are often contrasted with just how insane this world of assassins are. Just like the previous films, there aren't any expository information dumps and instead we just get to see how this world operates and understand the characters history through the way they interact with one another. This time we get to see how the chain of leadership works and how separate factions have developed amongst these assassins.A big part of building up this world comes from the supporting cast being filled with memorable personalities. The villains aren't just one note psychotic villains, but instead they have a genuine admiration for John Wick and even end up fanboying when they get the chance to fight him. Even smaller roles like Jason Mantzoukas as the Tick Tock Man leave a memorable impression with relatively little screen time.Though the best addition is definitely Halle Berry. She's essentially playing the female version of John, having also escaped the life of an assassin and who also has a keen fondness for dogs. She apparently did several months of both combat training and dog training, which she's able to show off throughout her scenes in a big way.Also this film franchise has convinced me that at least a tenth of the population in these films must be a part of this organisation since that's the only way this world could function as it does in the film, which just makes it all the more entertaining. The world itself is so well developed that I'd even be open to seeing some spin-off movies following other assassins like Halle Berry for future films. Though I'm still hoping to see more from Keanu in these films since it does seem like his ideal role and if these films continue the way that they're going, I expect that John Wick Chapter 4 will end up containing the most ambitious sequences yet.",

I have never seen a Series of films that are consistently delivering on their promises. This one has indeed that sort of rare quality. With close to realistic action sequences, great direction along with beautifully crafted cinematography, exhilarating sound design and Keanu Reeves as the main lead. We can't really get a better combination than this! Can we?Keanu just made this role on his own, we would never think anyone in his place as John Wick ever again. The characterisation is spot on. Halle Berry as Sofia nailed her character as well. The fight sequence with the dogs was just awesome. She was a total badass. I hope she would get more screen time in the next film though. Another strong point is that ; This film had so many breathtaking action scenarios but never felt over exaggerating. Every one of those scenes has been presented brilliantly. And varied with different set ups and weapons that are being used! The crime world they build in the franchise which abides by certain rules and regulations are a treat to watch. That set up helps immensely in the story build up. But unlike the previous films I didn't like the path it chose in this particular film. The different sub plots missed the cohesion and felt short on the impact part. Sometimes it seemed the story has nothing for progression; it just goes on without a certain motive and direction.Excluding the aforementioned flaw, the film was close to perfect. It's super entertaining as well as breathtakingly shot. Some scenes would be remembered for ages. If you are a Action Film fan, then you should and must watch this one. It's the epitome of the Action world.But make sure you have watched or at least known the previous instalments, otherwise you would be having a hard time grasping the story or the events connected to the past happenings.",

The character has moved from strong and feared to weak and a 'goal' which has turned the film into 2 hours of fighting with 10 minutes of conversation with Halle Berry.I hope they do a 4th, and I hope they take the character back to his roots. The character has legs to be a great franchise, if written correctly.",

        "text": "Suffering, yet resilient Keanu Reeves returns in \"John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum\" as retired assassin John Wick forced back into \"the game\" wreaking visually stunning havoc upon those, who seek the $14 million bounty on his body. Good luck. Rather, our condolences.In the astounding fight scene early on, Keanu's John takes on several assassins in the most electrifying screen knife fights ever. Keanu trained for months for \"Chapter 3\". He's an accomplished martial artist. Director Chad Stahelski brilliantly orchestrates this mixed and classic martial arts mash up.John and his deadly adversaries stab and hurl knives at each other, in close. John sweetly executes the classic Aikido wrist lock, \"kotegaeshi\", and hip throw, \"koshinage\", in flowing succession. The fight has spectacular elements of kali knife fighting, Brazilian Jujitsu, Muay Thai kickboxing, and other martial arts I don't know. At one point John hurls knives at his assailants like in carnival attraction booth. WTF, in an awesome sort of way.I thought \"John Wick: Chapter 2\" was the best action movie of the last 10 years. Director Chad's \"John Wick: Chapter 3\" is greater. In the movie trailers: John takes on motorcycle Ninjas with guns and katanas. In \"Chapter 3 - Parabellum\" way more is greater. Parabellum literally means \"prepare for war\". \"John Wick 3\" is the breathtaking non-stop action thrill ride. Granted screenwriters Derek Kolstad, Shay Hatten, Chris Collins, and Marc Abrams's story is lean on words, yet their muscular narrative amazingly compels.In Casablanca (yes, really), John reunites with the formidable woman from his past Sofia, played by beautiful badass Halle Berry, who owes her \"blood marker\" to John. She reminds, \"Consequences.\" He too acknowledges, \"Consequences.\" Yeah, John's vengeance is not just about bad guys killing his dog, the gift from his late wife Ellen, the love of his life.\"Chapter 3\" resumes where \"Chapter 2\" left off. John killed Santino, the man who called upon John's own \"blood marker\" and betrayed him to gain a seat at the criminal cartel High Table. John's dear friend Winston, played by weary wise Ian McShane, Manager of the Hotel Continental - the cultural sanctuary for assassins, had warned Santino that John would kill him. Because \"He came back for love.\" He came back for Ellen. Killing Santino, Winston declares John excommunicado - banished from the Kingdom, along with the $14 million price tag on his head. Winston grants John an hour grace period before 'it's on'.In the aftermath, Winston experiences the measured wrath of the Adjudicator, played with malevolent cool by Asia Kale Dillon, representing the High Table. She wants John dead and wants Winston out for breaking the rules, letting John escape. The Adjudicator also seeks to exact her 'pound of flesh' from New York gang leader, the Brewery King, played by hilariously ostentatious Laurence Fishburne. The Adjudicator hires elite ninja Zero, whimsically played by world-class martial artist Mark Dacascos.Mark is the invaluable upgrade from \"Chapter 2\". With all due respect to Ruby Rose's mute assassin, Mark's Zero is the imposing physical threat to John, as he thrashes John with series of spinning back kicks. Yet, \"John Wick 3\" retains a wicked sense of humor. Zero is fanboy of the \"Boogie Man\" John Wick. He confesses to John, \"You do not disappoint.\" I laughed out loud at a couple fanboy jokes near the end.Amidst the wry whimsy and bloody cinematic mosaic, \"Parabellum\" reveals a sense of gravitas, at least for me. In the Moroccan desert John finds his mentor The Elder, played by enigmatic Said Taghmaoul. We clue into what John really wants. Oh, yeah it's not about the dead puppy. In the surprising poignant narrative arc, Winston asks, \"Who do you want to die as, Jonathan?\" Maybe, deep down it's about love: The love lost, but not forgotten.Keanu Reeves is John Wick. I mean that in the best way. Keanu checks his emotions just beneath the surface. His John has suffered tremendously, yet fights with all his heart. Keanu's willingness to endure is endearing and honorable. He creates John as the tragic Hero we cheer for, to find peace, maybe even fall in love again.Keanu's John is much like us, albeit sans the assassin acumen. We all know suffering. We all deserve our own measure of peace. This is not a spoiler: I look forward to seeing Keanu in \"Chapter 4\", because of that. In the meantime, \"John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum\" is one my very favorite movies of the year. Just saying.",

However, after watching the 2nd...the John Wick series made me a huge fan. Now, after watching John Wick 3...man....this is building up like the MCU. I won't give any spoilers...but the fighting scenes are amazing...the plot is amazing. There will be many back stories to this JOHN WICK UNIVERSE lol. I can't wait for \"THE CONTINENTAL\" tv series this year. I'm definitely going to see John Wick 3 this upcoming week. Man, Keanu Reeves did an excellent job with the Matrix trilogy...and now John Wick. I don't think I've seen any actor have 2 successful trilogies. I mean, Jack Reacher started off good...2nd one was blah. The Equalizer is good...2nd one was good. Story line is average though. Only thing that makes the movie good is Denzel. Taken started off good....the 2nd and 3rd got crazy far fetched and stupid lol. To sum this up...if you haven't seen the first or second John Wick...I suggest you watch them. They are crazy good!!! I seriously believe that anyone that gives this less than 10 stars...isn't a John Wick fan....or don't understand (or care to) the plot. It's not just about John Wick being this overrated badass...because evidently he has his weaknesses and vulnerabilities...but he overcomes...that's what makes him the baddest assassin in the WORLD lol. Movie is A+++++++...definitely 10 stars(which is the max lol).",

I loved the first John Wick and really liked the second one, but JW3 really went over the top and overboard. It feels like the makers of this movie said \"People likes the action, so let's give them action and ONLY action.\" And that's when the action easily becomes boring, repetitive, dragged out, pointless and just fighting for the cause of fighting. John Wick used to be realistic, no nonsense and to the point, but in JW3 there's too many visually unappealing fights that's dragged out way to long. It's borderlining chinese movies like \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\" where the fights becomes more like people doing pointless dancing without any purpose or intention of actually killing the other person. And that's when you lose the realism and the danger.Besides, John Wick used to be the most feared, unbeatable, \"Baba Yaga.\" In this third installment there's enemies who's actually emasculating him by overpowering him and letting him live instead of killing him. That gesture totally diminishes his greatness and makes the movie kinda silly.",

        "text": "Stahelski, Reeves and company continue to escalate their excellence of craft, delivering the goods - and more - when it comes to all-out, breathtaking, wince-inducing action. Of course, 'John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum (2019)' gets a little indulgent. Its action scenes, which are almost exclusively fights, seem to go on for ages, which can be a little exhausting. They're all brilliantly crafted, that's for sure, but some of them come incredibly close to outstaying their welcome, often repeating similar gags one too many times. A couple are hampered, quite significantly, by seeming sort of arbitrary in the grand scheme of things, with tenuous ties to the overarching narrative. That narrative, too, is easily the weakest of the trilogy. It doesn't necessarily feel like a 'story', as such, and isn't even resolved, really. However, it has just as much charm as its predecessors. Plus, it aptly serves as a way to get Wick from extended set-piece to extended set-piece. These are as entertaining as ever and, perhaps, even more inventive. Each sequence has a specific 'gimmick', if you will, that keeps things feeling fresh. Whether its 'gun fu', the much talked about 'dog fu' or good old-fashioned 'Kung fu' (but not 'car fu', sadly), every action scene is wonderfully unique, excellently executed and effortlessly engaging. It's all just so exciting. The highlights, for me, are an early knife-throwing sequence and a late-game two-on-one face-off. The world-building, which might not feel as natural as before but still leads to several 'cool' moments, is also a big part of what makes the flick so charming. Even if the narrative isn't hugely satisfying, the characters, lore and action certainly are. There is, of course, storytelling through action, too. The piece just puts a smile on your face, despite often being quite grisly (more so than its predecessors in some select shots). Its action is pretty much perfect and it's a ton of fun. It really is great, one of the highlights of 2019. 9/10",

This was my second time watching it and when i saw it for the first time in the theaters for my birthday it was one of the best days of my life, i was laughing and screaming with joy the whole time. the cover art is amazing and soo cool and its all just played out. For once the movie is better than the trailer and i think this was the first movie that actually pulled that off. Choosing a favorite scene would be like choosing which one of you 10 dogs to kill that you spent all of your life with, impossible. I just cant explain its just soo good. When i first saw it i was like this isn't a movie its pure art its just something else. My moms favorite part was the part with the dogs because she loves dogs and she liked the way that they had to be trained to pull off all those stunts. I saw it in theaters with my mom and now i saw it with my mom and dad. Maybe it was just the theater that was soo cool. One guy that was next to my mom was laughing and banging on the seats when john wick killed somebody and so was i. Not my favorite movie movie ever, but this its definitely not the last time i will see it. This is the future of movies :)",

The first one set up an underground society of criminals which exists undetected with our normal live. It works perfect, you have to pay in a special currency to get into the club and all actions are more or less beneath the radar.\nIn the second movie this setup was slightly destroyed by introducing more and more people involved in this special society but I could bear it.\nThis part instead, set up a image that almost everybody is a Killer or part of this society. There're shootouts and actions in the mid of a town and it seems that there are no police everywhere. You can run threw New York and kill and shot as you like and there is no reaction but it seams to be normal to the citizens there.\nConclusion: The series moved from a action revenge movie in an interesting and cool universe to simply run and shoot movie what let me think of computer game. Sure the action scenes are cool, but action is the only thing you can see and the immersion is destroyed completely.",

John killed someone important and now he is on the run - from EVERYONE.When you have an unstoppable action hero movie, it always feels difficult to keep raising the stakes, but they surprisingly manage to do it a 3rd time.Does it have the same feeling as the first John Wick? No.Could anything else replicate that? No.Are they trying to achieve that? Also no.The movie is solid on its own. It employs excellent basics from great music to great visual composition, a nice selection of henchmen to be dispatched of by an ever increasingly angry John Wick and a nice cast of supporting characters showing up and providing more glimpses into the dark world that John Wick inhabits.There are parts of the movie that unfortunately felt a bit repetitive, but I wouldn't detract any points as at this stage it is difficult to find new and inventive ways of murdering people (they still do btw!), but this means that some scenes might feel a bit old. Despite this, each action scene is beautifully shot, the camera is still as ever and the feeling of force, violence and impact shines through the screen.From brutal takedowns, to great gun fights, horse chases and everything in between, John Wick 3 ups the stakes from all points of view.A lot more to say but doing so would spoil it.

        "text": "\"John Wick - Chapter 3 Parabellum\" (2019 release; 125 min.) picks up right where John Wick 2 ended: Wick is a marked man, declared \"excommunicado\" by the High Table, and with a $14 million bounty on his head. As the movie opens, Wick is on his way to the New York Public Library to retrieve a couple of high value items that he hid in a book. At the stroke of 6 pm, the bounty hunt is declared open, and immediately attracts the attention of bounty hunters. An Asian gang is the first to track Wick down... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: when you have a franchise on your hand following the unexpected mega-success of the first \"John Wick\", why mess with a winning formula? So not surprisingly director (and former stunt man himself) Chad Stahelski returns to bring us the third installment of the highly stylish, ultra-violent, and meticulously choreographed franchise. More is more, except when it comes to words, where less is more: \"What do you need?\" someone asks. \"Guns, lots of guns\" replies Wick, and that just about sums up the movie. Keanu Reeves could play Wick in his sleep probably. He certainly seems to be enjoying himself. Halle Berry's character has a 20-25 min. appearance in the movie, but Berry makes sure that every minutes counts. Anjelica Houston has an even smaller role, conducting ballet practices as danger comes her way (and only reinforcing the point that these fights are just like ballet). Laurence Fishburne makes a token appearance (maybe 5 min. of screen time in total). But none of this really matters. It's all abut John Wick doing what John Wick does best: hunting and fighting.\"John Wick - Chapter 3 Parrabellum\" opened wide this weekend. The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was sold out down to the very last seat, and the audience seemed to love the movie, laughing and hollering at all the right moments. Yes, I said laughing. You cannot take the movie at face value, nor was that the intent. Some of the scenes are so over the top, you can't help but laugh (while bodies are flying left and right). If you are a fan of the earlier John Wick movies, you know EXACTLY what to expect, and that is EXACTLY what the movie delivers. Of course I encourage you to check it out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",

The movie moved along quickly. The story was there but it was barely holding everything together. Mainly this movie was about great shootouts, and fight choreography, mixed in with small moments of dialogue to keep the party going.\nThe shootouts were great! The fight choreography was also great... in the beginning. Then something happened halfway through where it felt like the fight choreography was happening in slow motion. It was very noticeable, to the point where the fighting was starting to get predictable. What I mean by that is that the fights started to become less fluid. In Jackie Chan's films everything is high speed, tight, and fluid. Here it felt a little clunky, as if the actors were waiting to get punched or thrown.\nOne of the strong points of this movie were it's sets. Every set was full of color, and detail. What I mean by detail is that every theme looked just right. If you take a moment to look at all of the objects on set, or the buildings, everything looked like it belonged. It was perfect no matter what location John Wick was. One second, it's dark and seedy, then next the screen is filled with bright and warm colors. They did a great job creating themes based on the locations.\nSo, should you watch it or skip it? If you like action movies with crazy shootouts and fights, little to no story line then I'd say WATCH IT! This movie is definitely for you. I give it a solid 7/10. Would I buy it? nah. Would I rent it to see it again? Definitely.",

        "text": "The film continues where the previous one stopped. It is announced that Wick will be out of favor within an hour and a drive hunt will begin against him. The Stahelski-Kolstad couple is already shaking this film out of their little finger. Continuing the myth of assassins, several things emerge from John's past. All of these form a unified mixture that gives the feeling that it is good to fight John, to see him again.\nThey attach to it all by saying that there are more venues than ever before, there are more opponents, but there are also a few helpers. Such is Sofia, played by Halle Berry, who is Wick's old companion who helps him with a certain matter. Halle Berry superbly brings in the retired, directorial assassin. His dogs also help with the action, in which I think the trainers played a big role. They complement each other fantastically, moving almost as one. Lawrence Fishburne returns as King to spit the Upper Circle specifically in front of him and swear against them for trying to oust him from the Throne. That, however, is impossible because he is the Throne himself.\nThere is also the appearance of Anjelica Houston, who played an important role in the training of the main character. Houston brings the dignified director attractively. There's also a mystique and mystery in it that just makes it even more interesting.\nThen came Jerome Fynn... na, I expected him to bring something very surprising, cool, but I had to be disappointed. A simple piti little boss who selfishly cheats whoever he wants. Even the viewer.\nWhat was still weird and a little worn out during the film was the protagonist's motivation. While he still had the motives in the first part, here he can no longer cover himself by doing what he does just for his wife and his dog. It would be better if the writers started something with this later.\nThere were so many problems only the others had been better worked out.\nIan McShane is still the lord of life and death, though he is more powerful than him. And this is the Upper Circle. This organization also contributes to strengthening the myth of the film.\nWhat is even stronger in this work are still the action scenes. The equestrian-motor chase scene that took place at the beginning is a miracle in itself. It's so fast-paced and throws the movie that there's no better word for it. Cinematography also reinforces this. The action scenes shown near the party are well choreographed, I could kill you straight for the action scene in the grand total, they are so lousy. The point here is not to split the action scene to make it look more snappy, but the camera shows everything on one level and only moves by scanning.\nWe can't have a bad word for Keanu Reeves, that is for sure. This man is capable of anything but anything. He has now become one with John Wick, and together they are pushing the underworld criminal into the dust.\nThis piece perfectly continues Mr. Wick's story, with exciting new characters and familiar old ones, original storytelling, a slightly worn-out motivated but determined protagonist. We must definitely continue this intoxication to see how the fate of Baba Yaga is fulfilled.",

There is little else going on and in the end the story does not benefit anything from it all. I love Keanu Reeves and all his action sequences, sadly though, this movie is still a let down.I will say this about the fighting sequences though, they are entertaining to watch for a while, even somewhat towards the end (even if you get bored of just the mindless violence after a while) as each fight feels somewhat unique. The murdering on Mr. Wick's part is innovative and enjoyable to watch.As I said though, once it gets shoved into your face for two hours straight, you get bored of it in the end. The story just goes all around in a circle and leaves our main character back where he started. The killing scenes make little to no sense at times and the shadowy, assasin-type of kills are all but gone. Several people get killed in the middle of crowds of regular people in the city, but no one notices the killings OR in-plane-view guns and knives that the Table's associate arm themselves with. Bodies straight up teleport away after the people have died and no ordinary individual even looks that way. Sometimes it feels like the script-writer(s) just desired for the audience to turn their brains off.I can tell you, I do not like to turn my brain off when watching a movie, but that definitely was the feeling after this movie. As if I should have just pulled the plug on my brain whilst going through, what I can only view as a cinematic horrorshow with how dull and pointless it ended up to be.For those who enjoyed the movie, more power to you, however I am not prepared to give a dishonest review because of my love for the main actor. Hopefully this franchise will not continue down this road, but who knows.I will never watch this movie again, that much I can tell you, hence the score. Had it not been for the entertainment and innovative fight-scenes, I would have given the movie 1/10. It lacked story, it lacked sense, it lacked meaningfulness and lacked a good message.Thank you for reading.",

(Mark Dacacos) Zero not SUB-ZERO then he comeback to this big budget movie i needed him to see him in huge role i wish he got to be in movie a lot longer, but he did great it should him the passion, showed him how he is fan of john wick. I found a quote from the director saying he was a big fan of Marc Dacacos in Drive and Brotherhood of the Wolf. Very awesome he gave props to Drive. well Chad give Mark Dacacos more lead role movies but big budget movies. the fight scenes are no stunt doubles from keanu reeves. he does fight scenes for himself. i wanted this b*tch to die The Adjudicator (Asia Kate Dillon) she is villain character is a of The Adjudicator of High Table. she is character argues to much of why they let john wick lives and she always collects any information to kill john wick and judges people to kill john wick, it's hard to explain but first watch this movie and then you will understand how you want this b*tch to die we all have to wait for John Wick Chapter 4 because it leaves a lot of room for sequel for John Wick Chapter 4 and director i love and I'm sure the director of The Raid films is a big fan, he appreciates action scenes like these instead of Superhero fight scenes thanks to Chad Stahelski knows how to make old school action movies rather then marvel studio PG-13 kids movies this franchise owns Marvel movies any action movies of today owns marvel expect for punisher, deadpool, blade movies and Netflix marvel shows. this you can't beat this or put this above of anything.We didn't know if Derek Kolstad one of great action movie writer he has written Package (2013) Jesse V Johnson film, One in the Chamber, he should make and direct movies and make some another action movies like Expendables for explame he is well writer for john wick movies and he had thought that John Wick would be this big when he first created it, but when we came to the third film it seems clear how the story deepened and became beautiful and becomes a fantastic franchise that never failed it all successful.i rather give this much more credit and give this much of pass then to Avengers Endgame and action just keeps going on and on it never stops this action installment franchise is always non stop action the action never stops. this will be worth to see it at theater edge of your seat. This film offers you all kinds of action. The film has a unique style of action. Any action you can think of it's creative never seen any of action before and it is included in the third film. Moreover, exponentially! The enemies are increasingly jumping. As we saw in the trailer, that's why you don't check out the trailer at all never you have tosee movie as blind date not seeing the trailer thats best way for franchise to be for me i check out little teaser never check out trailer or big trailer it takes all action way. the action is not copyed any another action movies this movie created it's own action style like here is even a horse escape scene. nothing like scene from true lies when Schwarzenegger was chasing terrorist on it's bike the scene is a lot different There's so much more to it. At this point, sometimes there can be a small illusion in the viewer, also throwing 20 knifes everywhere, shooting and killing everybody just for one person who can kill everyone else just over 17 million dollars everyone makes excuse of themselves saying it was just a dog when it wasn't just dog. most idiots out their hates action films when they don't ever listen to the story at all and they are jealous as hell it doesn't forget the story. You will learn new and very interesting details of John Wick and you will get new ideas about the functioning of the universe of this amazing trilogy i love story goes all in order and how it goes for 3rd chapter i would tell marvel fans and tie them upside down to watch this amazing franchise that kick marvel out of it's ass. This is One of the Most Adrenaline Pulse Pounding Action/ Badass film of 2019, Keanu Reeves Kick A lot of Ass with his Shootings and Fights sequences, and a Great third film entry by making a perfect trilogy John Wick 3 Is the Defiantly The Best Action film of this year so far...",

        "text": "The 'John Wick' movies have never been about depth. In the latest, it is just frequent and frenetic action sequences one after another. Unfortunately, after some time - especially close to the end - it becomes way too much. Essentially, the entire franchise is a video game, each entry bringing diminishing returns. To conclude this, I didn't like performance of Halle Berry (also this so called gender equality becomes too much, but it's also made abundantly clear that Berry's character is being set up just for a potential spin-off); it was too long for my liking (131m); and you can literally see most of the times that \"bad guys\" not fighting in order to allow 'John Wick' to defeat dozens of them simultaneously. And yes, the rumors of this franchise concluding after a third movie have been greatly exaggerated.Rating: 6. If you like \"action\" movies you will like this, otherwise skip it.",

Who thought watching killing could be so much fun? I know, it sounds awful when said like that but I speak nothing but the truth.Wick picks up in chapter three where he left off in chapter 2: a fugitive of the High Table. He has to A.) stay alive and B.) figure out a way out of being ex communicado. That's not really easy when you have a $14M bounty on your head.Maybe I'm being a creature of the moment but I think chapter three was the best of them all; or at least the most fun. Chapters one and two were enjoyable but in chapter three Wick made the art of killing humorous and enjoyable.With each successive chapter we learn more rules, see more characters, and find out more of how deep the hitman network goes. All of the little revelations keep the franchise fresh without being ridiculous. Put another way, it seems well thought out and not as though they just threw ideas against the wall and went with what stuck. I don't know how far this franchise will go but I see it going very far.",

Not to spoil anything but some of the kills were especially brutal to watch (ie. book... that is all)The story does what needs to do with some revelations at the end - the script was quite witty and kept the interest when there's no action sequence going on, but be rest assured, the whole film's an action sequence with occasional breaks.So yeah, watch this as soon as you can.

Continuing from the final scene of the last episode, Chapter 3 finds John Wick running for his life after killing a member of the International Assassin's Guild. With a huge bounty on his head everywhere he turns he finds someone trying to kill him. This film is high octane and most definitely not for the squeamish. My only criticism would be that some of the fight scenes were a little too long, but that's a small niggle in an otherwise good film. Halle Berry along with her two canine bodyguards was a firecracker who stormed through the story as if the devil himself was after her. Non stop from start to finish, this film kept my interest right until the end credits. A good couple of hours well spent.",

I never expect a thick plot in JW franchise but this is almost like they are winging it as they go along. Like why dont we throw a horse in there? Or maybe a dog next time. How about giraffe in Time Square for JW4?!\nThe whole thing is mind numbingly stupid, the action is old and silly, the characters are cartoonish and to top it all, they added Halle Berry to do marshal art!!! For god's sake...\nIn contrast, you should watch Extraction on Netflix. Same sort of fast gamer action sequence but with depth. The setting much more believable and characters can actually deliver emotion. What a great contrast to this piece of junk.",

Just stare at Wick in some of the fight scenes and let your eye loose slight focus, and you'd see he's not really moving; its the other actors around him flailing wildly. By the 2nd half of the movie, I felt, \"been there done that\" with what I was seeing. Nothing was new or surprising. Every killer is a bad shot except Wick? Highly unlikely when they are all assassin's too. Those assasins would be pretty broke if they couldn't land a shot. Wick doesn't move faster than bullets, nor is he hitting any Matrix moves on them by back-bending or stopping bullets in mid-air. Now the fight scenes just feel impossible for a slow moving guy with what appears to be a former club foot hobbling around.",

Though, if you look carefully at Wick's face during the final martial arts skirmish in the glass house, you will see flashes of human emotion on the actor's face. Alas, nothing resembling human feelings crack through his blank stare at any other time in the movie. Remarkable amounts of high quality violence are scattered throughout, but we need to know if the weaponized dogs were trained to attack the men's private parts - or are these dogs related to the bear in THE REVENANT? It gives one paws.\nAnd it might not be an accident that the movie's first weapon (in the NYC Public Library) is a book - a very old, rare book. Are the screenplay \"writers\" sending us a subliminal message not to expect anything like an intelligible story for the next 2 hours? Are books the enemy of movies such as this?\nIt seems so. Still, it's a popular movie, so I guess that's something.",

Part of the plot in Africa is not clear at all how it affects the plot. I certainly understand that in the film, where the main thing - realistic production of action scenes the plot is not the most important, but not to drop to the level of Marvel in the development of the script.

More Matrix then your standard assassin flick, it pushes the characters, settings, activities, attire, and weapons to increasing levels of fandom. Will it ever over-saturate us to fatigue?

But above all, the theme and presentation of the underworld are top notch. It is pleasantly surprising to see the gangs following the rules and there is a system being followed by everybody.And of course, Keanu Reeves. You can just see him on and on. And never get enough of loving him.But in the end, this 3rd installment gets a little repetitive and boring sometimes. With lot many action scenes and styles are almost same and feels incessant. And the presence of the all powerful Elder is a little disappointment. Just couldn't imagine him sitting above that mighty high table and controlling global underworld.That being said, the John Wick series is undoubtedly one of most sleek and polished action movies you can see. Will await for further installments. it will be interesting to see Laurence Fishburne joining the party.If I may, just one suggestion to Chad Stahelski. The storyline and the plot is amazing. But when you create more than 3 episodes following a same narrative, it sometimes becomes a little boring. So please innovate the action scenes with something new.",

        "text": "I'm a bit disappointed by \"Chapter 3\" of the \"John Wick\" saga, not because, or entirely because, it's significantly worse than its predecessors, although I think it was unlikely from the get-go to surpass the artistic allusions and hall-of-mirrors sequence in \"Chapter 2\" (2017), but because it's a departure from the Greek mythology, of which I have some fond familiarity, of the first two chapters in favor of, or in a cocktail-like combination with, Russian fairy tales, of which I'm less knowledgeable. Unfortunately, I'm told, screenwriter Derek Kolstad and the rest of the filmmakers may also be less familiar with this folklore, mixing up the ingredients haphazardly.I do take joy in the dog jokes in this one, though, and their extension to \"dog-fu.\" Many, if not most, entertainment critics seem to celebrate or dismiss this series as unsophisticated spectacle. Indeed, it's spectacle--nothing wrong with that, but the narrative throughline of it has been the myth of \"Orpheus and Eurydice.\" The criminal underworld is also the mythological underworld, as in Hades. Hell, the Continental concierge is named Charon, as in the ferryman who carried souls across the river for coins--hence the gold ones in these movies. John as Orpheus, the poet who journeyed to the underworld for his dead wife. It was never about a puppy, so I love that Wick doggedly continues to correct others as to his motives. The puppy was the memory of his late wife, just as in a way are the phone video and photographs of her that he continues to look at. As with Orpheus, so too John Wick, his gazing upon Eurydice, or Helen, as in Helen of Troy, is what prevents the retrieval of his wife from the underworld--killing her twice over and forever. In this one, her picture is in the book-within-the-book that, in a sense, concludes, or begins the conclusion of, one chapter and begins another--Greco-Roman mythos to Belarusian féerie. Indeed, Wick goes to considerable lengths in this one in turning his back on that memory of Helen.A wonderful thing about this narrative emphasis on the gaze is how conductive it is to artistic reflexivity--so as John is gazing upon Helen, the pictures are full of other art for the spectator to likewise gaze upon. Yes, the gun-fu an' all, but also a neon-noir aesthetic, grand city architecture and straight-up art galleries. Even film of Buster Keaton turns up again in this one, as it likewise began \"Chapter 2.\" In effect, we're complicit in the metaphor of film as death--looking back at a ghost from the underworld. \"Portrait of a Lady on Fire\" (2019), another Orpheus and Eurydice tale, grasped this and so does the \"John Wick\" franchise. In this one, too, there continue to be plenty of artworks adorning the sets, and actual dancing in the form of ballet, which also nicely accompanies the move towards Russia in the worldbuilding, is added to the fight choreography.As for the Slavic folklore, the library book that's literally hit over a character's head and struck on or shoved into various other parts on his body, is \"Russian Folk Tales\" by Aleksandr Afanasyev. The Brothers Grimm of Russia. Note, too, that this hallowed-out book device is another thing... let's say, \"borrowed\" from \"The Matrix\" (1999) in a series that's borrowed a lot from that other series--and besides Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne. In \"The Matrix,\" it was Jean Baudrillard's \"Simulacra and Simulation.\" Although some critics, including Baudrillard himself, suggested \"The Matrix\" had very little to do with--was a misreading--of that text, basically it made some sense what the Wachowskis were going for with simulated reality. As for \"Parabellum,\" from what I've been reading since seeing the movie, Baba Yaga (the nickname for Wick) is something of a witch akin to the one in \"Hansel and Gretel,\" which doesn't seem to make much sense. Others have suggested this was a mistranslation on the part of the filmmakers, thinking they were translating \"boogeyman\" to Russian. Oh well.I have some slighter quibbles with this third installment, as well. As with the first \"John Wick\" (2014), the best bout comes in the middle--this time with a wonderful Halle Berry and her pet canines--which makes the rest of the movie a bit anticlimactic. The whole Casablanca and desert episodes seemed especially lost to me. The new vanishing gimmick comes across as just that, a gimmick--and an overused one. The escalating glass-house climax in the style of Bruce Lee's incomplete \"The Game of Death\" (1972) pales in comparison to the mirrors, also influenced by a Bruce Lee film, \"Enter the Dragon\" (1973), in \"Chapter 2.\" Nevertheless, there's plenty of exciting action here and enough of Greek mythology for me to rate this highly, if not as highly as the prior two chapters.",

Very satisfying that the character is traveling overseas. The world of John is steadily revealing itself to the spectator. The plot comes to be very violent. John is escaping. Seeks exit so he turns for help to his past. Somehow doing so he is getting deeper into the war. The war which has sparked among the power hungry players. He battles all the way. He is respected thus highly priced, an unmatched pawn. Only his dog is unconditionally faithful to him. A lot of good work has been done for this movie. Nevertheless, it inspires a few times. Mostly it is like a bus ride for sightseeing. The battle interactions overwhelm the characters' interactions. Also, it is as a gambling game that will never end. Might be that the story is diverging a bit too much from the initial idea. New characters, more administrative involvement, lots of guns and combat tech. Choreographies are not impressive after a certain point. The executions are like signatures in the action sequences. Bonus material movie is long but it can entertain well and probably give a better picture of John's world. Conflict scenarios are extremely well thought and give much value to the film. Gunfight challenges image and John learns. Will not consider it a virtual game copy. It keeps somehow the motion picture quality. This is the magic coming from this movie: it won't pass the into comic or game territory. Personally, watched it plenty of times. Enjoy!",

The first two I give a 10! But John Wick didn't seem as special in this one. The story seemed to rabbit trail around and not focus on him.

        "text": "John Wick Chapter 3 is not a movie but a collection of fantastically choreographed action scenes. Right from the word go, one witnesses innovative sequences that firmly place the movie at the helm of the action movie genre in the last few years.There is nothing much to talk about when it comes to the story. But then there wasn't much Story to begin with. The director doesn't try to add depth to the plot.In fact the fictional setting is made even more incredulou. Contrary to what I would have normally presumed, this exaggeration makes the movie more entertaining.There are some scenes that may appear repetitive or reminiscent of some classic duels from the 70s, but Keanu Reeves pulls off another spicy entertainer with this one.Like its predecessors, Chapter 3 doesn't burden your mind and is a good movie to watch.",

        "text": "Ok; so this one takes off exactly where John Wick 2 finished. The first 20-30 minutes of this starts off brilliantly, extremely compelling & state of the art superb fight sequences. But its really from there onward that this movie starts to get extremely repetitive: John Wick goes into a building, 40 to 50 assassins try to kill him, theres a fight scene involving John Wick beating them all up, he then goes into another building after being knocked down by a car but getting up uninjured, another 40 to 50 assassins there waiting for him And theres really only so much of this repetitive formula that us the viewers can take before we start to get bored.\nIn-between all of that,theres tattooed lesbian operators calling over the intercom the bounty on John Wick, highly important corrupt people coming out of the woodwork, a walk in the desert, Hallie Berry desperate to make an impression and grab the attention of would-be film makers that are going to be watching this letting them know she's still around cause lets face it - when was the last time Hallie Berry was on the big screen? a dire brutal parody performance from a normally credible Ian McShane, a credible cameo from Anjelicia Huston and lets not forget the lesbian one going from place to place barking orders at everyone, and even that lesbian one starts to get a bit tired & fed up as the movie progresses. O yes and Laurence Fishburne yet again with those pigeons.\nAs I said, this movie gets very repetitive, uninteresting, fails to stimulate, runs out of fizz (that said, an impression motorbike chase scene in mix) and by the final act involving a room made of glass and mirrors, I for one was examining my watch wondering how much time was left.\nNaturally enough after John Wick 2, expectations were sky high for this one, and it just turns into an over-cooked mess with the makers totally losing the plot & trying to pull the wool over our eyes. This movie is NOT as on the money or on the hyper beat as John Wick 2. Costing a budget of $55million with a run time of 2hrs 10mins, this movie would've been better had they shaved say 25mins off it onto the editing-floor thus reducing the budget to about $40million. As it stands, John Wick 3 is way too polished, scrapes the barbel for a riveting compelling story, depends on relentless repetitive fight scenes to keep it ticking over which as I said get a bit boring after a while, and it *tries* to be along the lines of Raid 2 but fails miserably to come even remotely close to being as brilliant as it with an exhausted Keanu Reeves doing the best that he can.\n[5/10]",

        "text": "John Wick 3 is absolutely busting at the seams with action. Picking up basically right where the second film finishes, the choreography and the action scenes are absolutely awe inspiring. Pure adrenaline, it's like Time Crisis on crack.Along with Keanu Reeves, alot of the familiar faces return (i won't sit here and list them i'll let you see for yourself), but Halle Berry appears as a pivotal character in the second act, another insane assassin who is much on the same skill level as John who is basically living in hiding to provide a safe and comfortable life for her daughter. We also get introduced to a woman who is an Ajudicator, a high up member of \"The Table\" and goes around handing down punishment to anyone who gave any shred of assistance to John after he was made \"Excommunicado\".The extra additions to this movie are sensationally executed. horses, dogs and motorbikes are all used in very creative and ingenious ways during the action sequences.There will be the haters saying boo no character development, action scenes ridiculous just like the second movie, repetitive shooting in the stomach and then the head combination. But if that's your base opinion of John Wick 3 then it's your own stupid fault for going to see it in the first place! You should have known what to expect by now. If you're after a trilogy with decent character development, probably steer towards something like the matrix trilogy. Besides, the character of john wick was already developed fully in the first movie in my honest opinion, the sequels are expanding on that and focus a bit more on teaching us more about the world of the assassins and the high table and the rules they have to follow.John Wick 3 is an absolute Sledgehammer of an action movie, Keanu Reeves and Chad Stahelski obviously have an incredible bond together as director/actor, and in case you're wondering yes the door is WIDE OPEN for a fourth movie and as far as the kill count is concerned, go ahead and try.... I don't even think Saving Private Ryan's body count was as high as this. IMDB will most likely upload the body count on their trivia page but i'll be curious to know whether or not it's accurate.I Can't wait to add this one to my 4K collection, or maybe 8K collection in the near future.... GO SEE IT!!!!!Fox.",

The idea of John Wick vs the world was a good one, but the writer made the mistake of having him rely on others too much I feel. The whole \"Casablanca\" portion was just so unneeded and seemingly just a way to get a \"female\" JW in the action (Halle Berry). The Elder was just laughingly bizarre. The worst part for me was that some of the assassins seemed to be toying with JW at the end. That was an unforgivable decision by the writers. JW is supposed to be the baddest a** killer in the world, when you have the chance to kill him, you do it. By making the scenes almost comical was a poor decision and took away some of the edge from the character. This film basically was a setup for JW 4 and there are some interesting plot lines moving forward, let's hope the errors in this one get corrected. Definitely worth seeing, but if you were a fan of 1 and 2, temper your expectations.",

However, for all the action it didn't have much focus on John as a person other than some superficial moments, which gave more depth to his actions in the previous installments. But the action packaged roller coaster still have a lot that makes it a worthy sequel. Also, what a cast! They even brought the villain from Raid.\nWhen they say that since he's excommunicated and the High Table have set 14 Million on his head the odds have become even, you know John wick is the greatest assassin ever seen on film.They told about a pencil in the first film and they showed how it's done with a book.",

Laurence Fishburne is still great, and Halle Berry, my goodness! she should get her own spin off. Her and the dogs! Epic...Iconic! I highly recommend this movie. Entertaining from start to finish. The stunts, the action, the direction, the fight choreography..awesome. I'm up and down on the ending but the series in itself is crazy so.....it is what it is. Excellent movie.",

While the action, the choreography and cinematography are better then ever, it feels John Wick is out of stories to tell.\nI don't expect much story from a movie like John Wick, but a little bit more emotional stakes or a goal would have been nice. Because the movie is 2 hours and 10 minutes long, only action and no narrative makes the action repetitive and boring. The ending also felt really cheap. The promise they made in the second movie is only prolonged by a similar ending in this one. What will likely be John Wick 4, should have been the second half of this movie.

Adding some deep moral story would be hypocritical and ridiculous as this is an ultra violent movie.It's a long music video where it's fight scene after fight scene with John Wick playing a deadly game of dance with his adversaries. The set of rules in the underworld serve as dark comedy and as a vehicle to somewhat humanize the bogeyman and the other players.It could have been a little bit shorter but if you liked the previous installments then Chapter 3 will not disappoint.",

They're fairly well done - although Halle Berry throwing all these burly bad guys around looks more like she has magical powers than martial arts skills - and they try to m ix it up as much as possible, but I respectfully submit that if you're not bored of it by the end there has to be something wrong with you. There's action in bucket-loads - but no actual drama. It's exactly like watching someone else playing a video game, with a few boring talky bits written in pseudo-epic gibberish: 'I'm here to adjudge your fealty!'. Visually it's like a cheap mock-up of Blade Runner - and for some reason it's always raining.It would have lightened the load if they'd cut half an hour from the running time. I can never understand why studios issue films at 2hrs+, when there isn't enough story for even half an hour. And after all that, you don't even get a conclusion - I guess you just go up to the next level.7.10.21 Having been forced by the woeful dearth of anything else on TV - actually that's a phrase they should use in the next instalment - to watch this again, I found that it isn't too bad as long as you're not giving it your full attention. Maybe you could play your own video game at the same time.",

They done so much fighting, I think they run out of ways to kill, and Choreography. It was not near as serious, and the scenes was not built up the same. It was a shell of the other two movies.

This movie did not outstay its welcome at anypoint and was entertaining from start to finish (yes, for 2hours 10mins, all the way). The story never outdid itself in a sense of \"Action for Action sake\". The humour was still present in the right places and the choreography for the action sequences was remarkable, you can really see and appreciate the time and effort all acting bodies have put into their roles. I look forward to the future of the franchise and hope to see it continue",

This film delivers the action big time and Keanu Reeves is outstanding as John Wick. Halle Berry turns in a fine performance and even her dogs get in on the action. If you're expecting anything but an action packed thrill ride then sure you won't like this film but what kind of movie do you expect when John Wick has a 15 million dollar bounty on his head? Top notch action from beginning to end is why I give John Wick Parrabellum 9 out of 10.",

Absolutely horrible writing. The writers, Derek Kolstad and Chris Collins, forgot what audiences fell in love with in John Wicks 1/2. But they surely didnt forget the main part...the fighting.",

We don't know if Derek Kolstad had thought that John Wick would be this big when he first created it, but when we came to the third film it seems clear how the story deepened and became beautiful.This film offers you all kinds of action. The film has a unique style of action. Any action you can think of is included in the third film. Moreover, exponentially! The enemies are increasingly jumping. As we saw in the trailer, there is even a horse escape scene. There's so much more to it. At this point, sometimes there can be a small illusion in the viewer. Only action-oriented films can be considered empty. We can say that John Wick 3 offers almost uninterrupted action for 2 hours and 10 minutes. But in doing so, it doesn't forget the story. You will learn new and very interesting details of John Wick and you will get new ideas about the functioning of the universe.Stahelski has very impressive shots.The main venues preferred for the main fights were especially appreciated. The fact that the director's vision is so blended with Keanu Reeves and other actors is very effective on the traceability of the film. Stahelski deserves great praise.The film also brings new characters. One of them is Sofia, played by Halle Berry. Obviously the audience will love Sofia. Halle Berry has done a great job. Mark Dacascos is one of our main villains; He portrayed the character Zero in the film.Among the action films, it was both a strong story and an ambitious way of action. I think that the action-lovers will be pleasure separated from this film. 9/10",

Plenty of action like John Wick but without the clever storyline.The element or perhaps legend that brings this movie to life is Keanu Reeves.Love the scenes with Halle Berry. She also delivers. Also love the guy on reception - am working on replicating his accent.Excellent movie collection. Highly recommended. Look forward to JW4.",

        "text": "This film essentially begins where its predecessor left off with the renowned assassin \"John Wick\" (Keanu Reeves) being hunted by every hit-man and bounty hunter in the world who are eager to collect a $14 million reward put out for his violating the sacred principle of killing someone at a Continental hotel. Additionally, the fact that this person was a high-ranking member of an elite council known as the High Table also adds to his predicament. In any case, alone and heavily out-manned and out-gunned, John Wick realizes that instead of being the hunter he has become the hunted and that in order to survive he will have to defy the heavy odds and kill everyone that comes against him-and that number is staggering. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an entertaining movie for the most part but-unlike the two films before it-it lacked both character development and an in-depth and realistic plot. Likewise, I thought Halle Berry (as \"Sofia\") was badly miscast as well. Even so, while I don't believe this film was nearly as good as its predecessors, I thought it was still worth watching and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",

It was incredible.John Wick 2 expanded on the back story just a little, gave us more action, but kept it grounded. We learned more about this world John operates in. It pulled back the curtain just a little and left us wanting more.It pains me to say but John Wick 3 is filler just to set up John Wick 4.We got a deeper look in to the world above and below the table, but it felt, well, a bit silly. The fight scenes, whilst incredibly visceral often dragged on a little too long. They were padding to cover the lack of coherent story. By the end I found myself questioning decisions - they didn't make sense. The world of John Wick opened up, and was actually a bit naff. The film suffers from a need to try and one-up it's predecessor - it amps up the action, pulls back the curtain too much and almost moves in to self parody.I still love John Wick and the world they've built. But this is overall the weakest of the 3 films even though the fight scenes were often incredible.",

The fight scenes are predictable, so it suggests some continuing lack of skill, thought and laziness on the part of the producers / directors. It's easy to see they have set this up for a Part 4, so they are milking the franchise for all they can. At some stage, if they keep going along lazily with a formula, the whole thing will fall over and tarnish the cleverness of the original idea. But the movies are making mega amounts of money for all concerned, so maybe they no longer care about the integrity of the art they are creating. Or maybe they never cared about the art and only cared about the money? Regardless of how I feel about it all, I have enjoyed all 3 John Wick episodes to date.",

It doesn't try too hard to surprise you, the style is flashy and sharp, but the action- the action is downright jaw dropping. And here in the 3rd outing, it reigns king. You'll definitely shout when you see what john Wick can do with a book.Plot- Easy, just like you want it. He's on the run from everyone under the high table (the fictional assassination conglomerate of the Wick universe) with a bounty of 14 million over his head. He faces more advanced enemies, very close calls, and ventures far away from home. It's a hell of a time.Characters/Acting- Wick is more lethal than ever, using new methods of execution. He's still bad to the bone and seems more convincing here. Halle Berry absolutely killsssss it in her role, whooping ass as if Keanu trained her for years. The villains are interesting, not too far from typical but always well played.Writing- Some highly predictable lines like \"Guns....lots of guns\" but otherwise very spiced up and actually hilarious when it intends to be. Simplicity is key.Quality- I wish I could just clap for this section. The cinematography, perfect. The choreography- even more dazzling. The one shot fighting scenes blow me away. Keanu is a master. The music- driving and has that 2000's vibe. It's rock solid.Overall I recommend that any action fan should get up right now and go see it. I won't over exaggerate on an action movie, ever, and these three films struck me as probably the best action trilogy in the last 19 years aside maybe Marvel or Fast and Furious films. You want a blast, go see this please.",

Keany is slow, clumsy, maybe tired in real life, not for the performance, and his opponents just wait for him to finish them off after stunning them, usually with a hit or two. The man can't fight, it's obvious. Why are torturing him with this acting? And why are you torturing us with watching it?\nCouldn't watch the movie to the end.

This 3rd installment makes you really think back and realize that yes, this isnt the world we know- its different. Pardon the cliche but think matrix, which there is an awesome one line nod to here; and how that opens up a suspension of disbelief that directors chad and leach somehow dont make us question that suspension. It just is the world you enter when your stub is torn. Really... this john wick story can go on to another trilogy.I will see this again in theatres, just to pay for the true sense of film and art. Not that cashhrab endgame garbage. Watch this movie, dont blink, and pray for a 2nd trilogy (the directors intellingently implied another universe within this one we already know). I say up the ante and go it for a 4th. Best trilogy since (choose one).Who would have thought that Keaunu is arguable the best actor of his generation. How did he avoid major typecast? Commitment. Watch his 3-gun on youtube and yea, he does more stunts than the cruise. Sorry, Tom.Lastly: keep an eye out for the best martial artist from around the globe. A+ wick. And your little dog, too.",

Fight scenes themselves were low quality compared to many Asian movie fight scenes. Many scenes not logical like while being chased he's in an armory w/many weapons yet fails to take any when he leaves. His friend Sofia goes into a warlord's house w/two dogs; one gets shot, but next scene she back to two dogs. While walking in an immense desert with a suit on he's doesn't remove his jacket to cover his head from the overwhelming Sun's heat.\nSumming up: They left plenty of room for sequel 4, 5.",

        "text": "Greetings from Lithuania.As a pure action film, \"John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum\" (2019) is a 10/10 experience. But the story in here unfortunately does not hold up to the action. Surely it follows the storyline set in a first film, but that was some time already ago and they kinda need to start moving in some other direction with plot. That said, as an action film purely, \"John Wick 3\" is a blast. Fight scenes, action, choreography is a Hollywood at its best. This movie is also very brutal, like in a knife scene in museum - you won't see this kinda stuff in your average flick. But it is not a gore fest, thankfully.Overall, \"John Wick: Chapter 3\" is a spectacular action movie that start to loose its steam a bit because of the story. I know its for a dog, not a simple dog but common.",

This film had a great 15 minutes, John on the run straight after chapter 2, I really like the 'excomunicado scenes and the count down' - also the library fight and scenes with the doctor. From then on I enjoyed the knife fight scene and learning more about John's past with the director, I like the addition of the ajudicator character however I wish we learnt more of her and the high table - as well as the Director. I also think that Charlise would be a more suitable actress for the role. I liked the scenes in Morroco, however even though i like action it dragged on for too long, same with the ending fight scenes. Prop to the stunt crew, and the filmers because they were all clean cuts, no shacking which I loved.Overall:\nReally good film - great action, however in some cases the fights were a bit too long - more focus on storyline needed - in which the first 15 minutes conducted.Props to all in producing a nice addition to the John Wick series.",

        "text": "25 minutes into the movie, and I was already disgusted. These bounty hunters who want John Wick dead for $14 million are effing idiotic!! Apparently the reward amount makes everyone want to hunt down Wick, but EVERYONE has no damn education and are CONSTANTLY giving him opportunities to fight back. Sure, it's a movie and Wick needs to live, but within the first 25 minutes, there were 4 encounters that were just so fricking disappointing.The first guy wants to try to kill Wick with a long knife... Really? The guy is really tall, but why didn't he just use a gun when he had distance between himself and Wick? The next group is a bunch of asians, which you see chasing together, but during the fight scene, they roll in one by one to only get killed by Wick. And the fight scene just kept getting dragged out and got boring really quickly. The third group starts off by smashing their car sinto Wick (one car and then the second car waits for Wick to get up to finish driving into him...so stupid). The guys in the cars wait for Wick to run away, making me think okay, they don't have guns to immediately pull out, but after they get out of the car, the next shot shows them with guns. But of course, since they let Wick hide, they get picked off one by one. Typical. Then another dumb couple (one of which has a gun) chase Wick on their motorcycles. Rather than shooting him, they \"tug\" on Wick's jacket, so Wick responds by grabbing a gun from the back of that guy and shoots him. Wooooo... so cool!! When the next biker rides next to Wick, instead of Wick just shooting him, Wick felt compelled to hang off the side of a horse just to take a shot. WHY?!?!?! The most pointless moves seriously irritated me.This is such a ridiculous movie. And EVERY SCENE is TRASH. I get that they don't want to show close ups that ruin the fight, but in this movie, I really wanted that because Keanu Reeves was terrible at fighting. He constantly left himself open to so many shots, stabs, punches, etc., but the movie wants us to think that Wick is so good that he can defend himself. Whoever was choreographing the fight scenes needs to be FIRED. The fight scenes in Chapter 1 and 2 were much better.",

Sure it's still a decent action movie, but it pales in comparison to the groundbreaking original film.My biggest complaint is the action is not what it once was. You can see the baddies (who are supposed to be trained assassins) hanging back in group fights and waiting for their turn to attack Wick. You can see assassins armed with guns get within arm's reach of Wick without firing a single shot. Maybe this is because Keanu is getting older, but honestly I think the issue is with the production team. Simply put they could have choreographed and shot the action scenes in such a way that it wasn't so blatantly obvious how scripted the fights were.My other complain is that this movie does not really have an ending. Its more of a \"to be continued\" type of thing.Truthfully I will still watch John Wick 4. But I certainty don't expect it to be anywhere near the masterpiece that the 1st movie was.Recommended to action fans, but discerning viewers watch out, the cracks in the series are starting to show.",

He gets some limited help at certain times, but overall John has to fend for himself.More action than you need in any one sitting, I'm rating John Wick a 8/10. Would have been 9/10 if not for some pretty big inconsistencies in Continental providing amnesty to John (unresolved, there are aways... consequences... but we don't find out), and the one other criticism is the motives of the combatants in the drawn out final fight is extremely unclear. Are you killing each other or not? Other than that, John Wick Chapter 3 is one bloody gory ride that meets expectations if that's what your looking for.",

He attempts to get out of New York with every crack assassin in the city (even the world) out to get him.I have to say, as much as I love the John Wick series at times, during this one, it's starts to become a bit too much, particularly after watching the previous two relatively recently. The opening stuff is phenomenal; the scenes as he tries to escape New York are some of the most inventive stuff in the whole series. However, repetition starts to creep into the fights, particularly towards the end as, for example, the film wrings the full benefits out of its expensive glass set by having Wick crash through each of the (what seems like) 15 display cases there. Don't get me wrong, even in those concluding scenes there is some glorious invention - the soldiers in the impregnable suits that are only stunned by bullets is incredible. I am here for the violence, really I am, but three films in less is starting to be more.It's also too long maybe as much 30 minutes too long and it's hard not to think that it's the Casablanca scenes that are the ones that pad the run time. The dog attack scenes are OK, but stretch the credibility at bit as the stuntmen involved have to wait and in some cases visibly hold out limbs for the dogs to get at. The whole section seems to be pointing towards Wick having to make a difficult choice in order to get his life back, but when that choice comes we don't spend nearly enough time with Wick's decision making to actually care about it.Overall, I still enjoyed the film and I'll be back for Chapter four but I do hope that it's tighter and cleverer that this entry.",

The first was a refreshing revenge thriller that reveals hints of a larger underground world of assassins in which Wick has become iconic. The second is a hyper-stylish fleshing out of that unseen world. Now the third is the John Wick: Fury Road of the series: a no-holds-barred action extravaganza that giddily revels in its own mythic creation with nearly incomparable gusto.\nComing directly on the heels of the cliffhanger-ending second film, we find Wick on the run from...well, everyone, as he's been excommunicated from the benefits of the assassin community, with a $14 million bounty placed on his head. This character has always been Reeves at his most comfortable best, but he's truly settled in here with subtle, bad-to-the-bone perfection. He's as endearing to the audience as he is terrifying to his foes.\nStahelski has officially cemented himself as a true directorial voice. We now know that the first movie wasn't just a clever fluke, but a signpost of cinematic genius. In what is the best action film since Kill Bill, it's all violence as poetry in every heart-pounding moment (clumsy knife fights, death-by-library-book, Halle Berry's dogs).\nBut it's not just the breathtaking action scenes that sing, but all the quieter moments in between too. The surprising complexities of this universe are unveiled even further here, still somehow without the crutches of exposition or narration, instead letting the world speak for itself. It all speaks to the punk-rock ethos of anti-fascism, reminding us that the system doesn't care about us unless we serve it. Parabellum is smart, fast-paced, deep, and more fun than a sword-wielding horse ride through Manhattan, and is the first masterpiece of 2019.",

The dogs where cool but the Halle Berry character was made to be a female john wick just showed her ego. She looks frail, It was embarrassing. I was so glad to see she was only a temp character.As for the rest of the movie the action was great but they will need to change it up in 4 or it will become tired. John wick is becoming too powerful and unstopable....he is getting to be a little too marvelesk.",

        "text": "Review:\nAfter enjoying the first 2 movies in this franchise, I really didn't expect to see anything new in this film. How wrong was I! From Kung-Fu horses to angry fighting dogs, the director really pushed the bar with this third instalment, and he actually gave us an insight into the High Table, who put out a $14 million bounty on John Wick's head. There does become a point where the action feels a bit repetitive, but once the Adjudicator lays down the law, it becomes more interesting. Keanu Reeves puts in his usual, unemotional performance, which was perfect for this role, and the additional casting of Halle Berry, Ian McShane and Laurence Fishburne was a great touch, even though they weren't in the film for that long. In true Liam Neeson form, Keanu is proving that he can still kick butt at the age of 55, against the young assassins that attack him throughout the film, but the dodging of bullets and numerous stab wounds made it seem unrealistic. For such a low budget, I was amazed by the attention to detail, especially in the glass room which they built from scratch, and the dark and moody tone worked perfectly, in terms of the intensity throughout. The ending left the franchise open for numerous avenues for John Wick to take, now that he has joined forces with Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne), so I can't wait to see the 4th instalment. I also want to see if they bring back Halle Berry (Sofia), with her killer dogs, and I was left a bit confused about Winston (Ian McShane) who switched at the last moment. Anyway, I quite enjoyed this movie, even though the action did go a bit overboard in places, but it's what we have grown to expect from the lethal hitman, who just won't die. Enjoyable!Round-Up:\nThis movie was directed by Chad Stahelski, who also brought you the previous movies in this franchise. It's rumoured that he will be directing the new Highlander, but the storyline hasn't been announced yet. I just hope they don't make a mess of it! With Chad doing most of the fight scenes in this movie, and Halle Berry breaking 3 ribs in rehearsal, the movie took longer to release, but the studio must be happy with the profit it made at the box office. A fourth instalment has been announced to be released in May 2021, even though it was only supposed to be a trilogy, but after it's success, the filmmakers wanted to continue to expand the universe in which the films take place.Budget: $75million\nWorldwide Gross: $327millionGenre: Action, Crime, Thriller\nCast: Keanu Reeves, Halle Berry, Ian McShane, Laurence Fishburne, Mark Dacascos, Asia Kate Dillon, Lance Reddick, Tobias Segal, Anjelica Huston, Said Taghmaoui, Jerome Flynn, Randall Duk Kim, Margaret Daly, Robin Lord Taylor, Susan Blommaert, Jason Mantzoukas, Andrea Sooch and Sergio Delavicci. 7/10",

I have never had to look away in anything even game of thrones but some of these deaths made me cringe.John Wick Parabellum is a thrill ride of the most beautifully and meticulously chereographed fight sequences I've ever seen put to the screen. It has way more set pieces than the pervious two movies and puts Wick on the defensive for 90% of its runtime. Keanu deserves a ton of praise for the success of the movie as his physical dedication to the character is turned up to 11 for this movie.Halle Berry gets to show off all her training even if she plays a smaller role than I would have thought. The cinmetography is surprisingly great. Overall this movie is 9/10 and my rating scale does not cross genres, so as an action movie this is a close to perfect as you can get. My only complaint is the ending but I won't spoil it here. So if you like the first two you will love this, so sit back for 2 hours of beautiful mayhem.",

        "text": "John Wick 3 picks ups straight after the events of Chapter 2. Wick (Keanu Reeves) has broken the rules and is now hunted by the whole underground world of assassins. To earn back his right to exist, he must resort to drastic measures.John Wick 3 is once again a really good action film. All the fight scenes and shootouts are filmed with very little shakycam, most often as a wide shot, allowing you to see the movement and choreography of the fight evolve in front of your eyes. It's suitably brutal to please even the most hardcore fans, yet there's almost poetry to it as a whole.That being said, I didn't find the fight scenes to be quite on par with the previous films. There was simply something missing, something tiny and hard to measure. Perhaps it's the fact that John was almost always getting beaten up. Which makes sense, the two previous films would pound anyone into dirt, but the fact still remains that it's not quite as pleasing to watch when your protagonist is constantly at the end of his rope. Sometimes that's exactly what the scene needs, but if the whole film is like that, it quickly becomes exhausting.I also really didn't like the world building in this one. Too much too quickly, without any clear purpose or direction. The two previous films hinted and alluded to this world of assassins, where even the most bloodthirsty killer had to operate by the rules. It was suave, it was slick and it was undoubtedly cool. But, it was never completely explained. This movie sets out to hammer out those rules and the underlying structure of the world. And it's not as cool as I imagined it to be. In this case I would have preferred to imagine my own rules.It's also not internally consistent. For example, there's this phrase that's said out loud quite often in the film. \"I have served. I will be of service.\" It's a pretty cool line, but the problem is that there are numerous moments in the previous films where it could have been said, and in fact should have been said. But this film is the first time we ever hear it, which makes it clear that they only came up with it when writing this third film in the franchise. And that breaks the illusion, it shatters your suspension of disbelief.Chapter 3 is not a bad film by any means. It has great locations, great action, great acting (especially from Reeves) and it's still one of the best action franchises out there. But it also isn't the masterpiece its predecessors undoubtedly were.",

Of course he wouldn't have just up and walked away from some of the things that happen to him, but that's the point of the movies (espically this one) to be over the top and entertaining. It gets away with this by not taking itself too serisouly and even acknowledging how absurdly resourseful John wick is by having everyone be obsessed with telling the pencil story. The movies are self aware and use dark comedy a lot which is why they can get away with being \"unrealistic\". So yes they are over the top but it works.That being said, lets talk about how good this movie is! I absolutely love the first movie and the second one is equally amazing but I do have to say that JW3 is probably the most fun to watch so far. Some of that has to do with the fact that I saw it in theaters and watched the first 2 at my house, because I was late in discovering the franchise. But that' also becaue they really upped the action. Everything was bigger and we got to see deeper into the world of assassins. The action scenes are some of the best I've seen in movies and knowing that many of them are done in long takes with only a few cuts makes them even better and more impressive. The set design is also incredibly impressive and adds greatly to the richness of the world the characters live in (as all great set design should).Overall the movie is very good and enjoyable and I would highly recommend it to any fan of action movies. And if you don't like action movies I'd still sugest it because it jut might change your mind.",

        "text": "John Wick: Chapter Three - Parabellum (2019) -He must go to the same running club as Harrison Ford.Because this is a continuation from the last film, it can't really be viewed as a completely separate film in its own right.Despite being the third and a follow on, it still manages to be different enough though.It can't be easy to come up with new ideas for a hitman over and over again, so it's interesting to see that there are at least a further two instalments planned. I hope they don't start to get too repetitive, as I for one, look forward to seeing what happens next, which I never thought that I would say. I had expected John to have got on my Wick by now, but not at all.If I had to criticise, I would say that some of the fights were slightly dragged out and the desert scene felt a bit like Wayne's hallucinations in 'Wayne's World 2' (1993) or the home of the sand worms in 'Beetlejuice' (1988), which took me away from reality a little, but not so much that I lost the thread.Angelica Huston always plays an interesting part, although not always successfully, but she was good in this one and even Halle Berry is enjoyable too. Other than the 'X-Men' films, I don't have a lot of experience watching her, but this character seemed to be a good fit for her. I hope she comes back in the expected sequels.One of the things I love about the existing trilogy is the way that they always make sure that the enemy is dead with a bullet to the head (You don't want them coming back as Zombies do you?). It just seems more believable that way, assassins wouldn't leave anything to chance that the wounded might keep coming back for them or be a witness to what they've done.Overall, this is another successful chapter of the 'John Wick' franchise and Keanu is even more muted than ever, which is great for me.Does the dog steal the limelight? Yes, a little bit, but that was always going to be the case.638.83/1000.",

        "text": "I enjoy the first and even the second John Wick, but with Parabellum it's starting to stagnate. These films have always been based on simple plots that serve as justification for the action but the motivation seems to get weaker and weaker.There is some decent action, but it's hardly top ten material. It's admirable that the actors rehearsed intensively to perform the action sequences, but the problem is that it looks too rehearsed; the way they move is too mechanical. There is also too much action, and a lot of it is so similar it actually gets boring.In addition, despite the tactical realism they attempt portray, there are many things that strain credulity. In the final shootout Wick isn't even grazed by a single bullet. His opponents have worse aim than Stormtroopers, and they're supposed to be part of some super-secretive, elite league of assassins.I had hoped this third film would serve as a satisfying conclusion, but it's just another chapter that dangles the possibility of another sequel because apparently Wick's kill-count isn't high enough yet. After Parabellum I have little to no interest in seeing the story continue.",

        "text": "Though it may contain common action film tropes, John Wick 3 shines brighter and especially crazier than any action film before it by providing a purely fun and violent adrenaline rush that is sure one entertaining ride. Keanu Reeves greatly embodies the character again, and the same for any actor returning their previous roles, as well as some new ones. The villain is somewhat underwhelming and is a bit odd to get behind, but it certainly doesn't take away from the enjoyment of the film, and certainly doesn't make it any less entertaining. The script is surprisingly well balanced, and each fight scene (of which there are a lot of) is mastefully coordinated as always and though some fight scenes may not be the best fight scenes necessarily, there has certainly never before been as many as this one has to offer. In the end, the film is fun, wildly entertaining, and awesome which is everything I wanted from the film and more. Here's to more possible and awesome sequels in the future.\nMy Rating: 9.5/10",

        "text": "John Wick (Keanu Reeves) having been deemed \"excommunicado\" by the High Table for killing Santino D'Antonio on The Continental grounds now finds himself on the run with no access to The Continental resources and carrying a $14 million contract on his head that every assassin is itching to collect. With limited options, John cashes in on some favors in the hopes of reaching The Elder (Saïd Taghmaoui) the one man who stands above the High Table. Meanwhile The Continental manager Winston (Ian McShane) and The Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne) are visited by the High Table's Ajudicator (Asia Kate Dillon) and are subject to fallout for helping Wick and find their spheres of control in jeopardy.John Wick marks the third entry in the ever popular John Wick franchise building off the ending of Chapter 2 that left John on the run for his life with every assassin the world over hungry for the contract placed on his head. Chad Stahelski returns to the director's chair as does writer Derek Kolstad (along with three co-writers) and the movie continues Wick's fast paced and brutal journey through the elaborate criminal underworld established over the first two films. John Wick Chapter 3 Parabellum is still on point with the franchise's pedigree, but the formula is beginning to show some wear.Once again Reeves is well suited to the role of John Wick and finds the character placed in a desperate situation where he's cut off from the resources and allies he had in the first two films. Like the previous films Reeves says a lot without saying much at all and owns both the action sequences and character moments present in the film.The movie is well shot with the action choreographed and photographed with precision that allows the action to flow naturally and with clear establishment of spatial geography and impact with some well done sequences in both New York and Casablanca with good usage of the environments and their incorporation into the action beats. Some action scenes are a little too familiar such as a sequence involving an elaborate room made of glass that reminded me very much of the \"reflective corridor\" scenes from the climax of Chapter 2.The supporting cast is excellent with returning players Ian McShane, Lance Reddick, and Laurence Fishburne welcome returns, and newcomers like Anjelica Huston and Halle Berry welcome additions to the cast with Huston's credibility as an actress leading to a great scene between her and Reeves involving John Wick's past, and Halle Berry showing some great physical prowess as the Casablanca Continental manager whose fight scenes with Reeves that incorporate the character's two dogs in some intense well staged action beats. But by far the best addition to the cast is Mark Dacascos as Wick's primary antagonist credited as \"Zero\". Dacascos never really go his due as an action star with most of his work consisting of low grade DtV projects and his best works like Crying Freeman or Drive using having distribution or post-production issues that didn't let them reach a wide audience. Dacascos is given his chance to do some really strong work both in screen presence and action sequences and Dacascos' sword fight with Reeves in the climax is really quite satisfying.My main issue with John Wick three is it feels really overstuffed. I already felt like John Wick Chapter 2 indulged itself a little too much with its expanded scope and budget, but at 2 hours and 10 minutes John Wick 3 finds itself with a lot more bloat. While Angelica Huston is an always welcome addition to any film, it's pretty clear the only reason she's here is because she's setting up the premise for the in-development spin-off film, Ballerina. Both Halle Berry and Angelica Huston play characters who owe John a favor, and there's no reason why they couldn't have been merged into one character except for setting up that spin-off. Shay Hatten is credited as one of three other screenwriters with Derek Kolstad unlike the first two films that featured Kolstad as the solo writing credit, and it's pretty clear the reason there are so many credited writers is because of all the inserted material setting up threads for Ballerina, the spin-off TV series The Continental, and forthcoming installments in the main film series. While I still overall enjoy the movie, the main plot of John Wick being on the run doesn't carry enough weight to justify its 2 hour and ten minute and the excess bloat that nakedly serves to establish other projects just weighs down on the movie.John Wick 3 continues to deliver on action and charisma, even if the movie's worldbuilding and lore are starting to become burdensome at the expense of the movie itself. The cast are all great with a nice scene stealing performance from Dacascos as Zero and the movie shows there's still life in the franchise even if it flirts with franchise fatigue.",

        "text": "The first two John Wick films are like a fun night of drinking. We regale ourselves of memories past, we have a good time and then go home in a spirited stupor. The problem is, we are not young anymore and we wake up with a stunning sickness. The hangover is real, and while it is not intense we kinda regret drinking too much the night before as we chew through a greasy breakfast burrito and swig liters of Gatorade. But we knew the risks, and this is what can happen.Usually, the third movie in any saga has to follow a certain story archetype. You either revamp the whole thing with a different visual and story aesthetic (a la Die Hard With a Vengeance) or utilize the near limitless budget you have at your disposal to hide the bare bones continuation arc (a la The Return of the Jedi). John Wick 3 went hard on the latter. This is not judgement on any part of the movie....but dang there is so much fighting and violence you barely have any time to absorb the story.Of course, there is very little added story to this chapter, for John Wick is being chased by every assassin that dares to chase the dream of a 14 million dollar bounty. The stakes have been raised significantly as such a film is required to have, but it seems a little redundant in this case. We do see some new glimpses into this world of crime, witnessing the fact the crime underworld has its own SWAT team and an even more defined hierarchical structure than first imagined. We get some new characters, witness the consequences of collaborating with John Wick and we get some kick ass scenes with the ever hammy Mark Dacascos. However, we get very little else in the process. I think the only reason this film was made was to benefit on the carnage this film was promising.Hopefully the lack of plot is not a hindrance in chapter 4. While this was a blistering and fun ode to action flicks of old, we still need a little more story to bolster the world we dive into for a couple hours at a time.",

Years ago, a little puppy unleashed the torrent of the Baba Yaga's rage as millions of extras were taken out by coordinated destruction in some of the most adrenaline pumping films this decade. John Wick has become a cult phenomenon that has gotten guys like me revved up in all the high-octane fun that comes with the dark action flick. A third installment has appeared this weekend, with our \"hero\" now being on the run from the very organization he has served for so long. Will the third installment be able to expand upon the universe, or is it just too much? Robbie K here with another review on:Movie: John Wick 3: Parabellum (2019)\nDirector:\nChad Stahelski\nWriters:\nDerek Kolstad (screenplay by), Shay Hatten (screenplay by)\nStars:\nKeanu Reeves, Halle Berry, Ian McShaneLIKES:Comedy\nDogs\nUse of Second Characters\nExpanding The Story\nFast Pace\nAction Sequences/ChoreographyDISLIKES:\nExcessive Violence\nSome Underwhelming Story arcs\nThe Excessive Destruction\nUnrealistic moments taken too far at times\nThe EndingSimilar Movies:\nJohn Wick 1 and 2\nKill Bill Vol 1 and 2\nNinja AssassinSUMMARY:When it comes to John Wick you know what you are getting into and in terms of likes the movie just continues to expand upon the legacy of the Baba Yaga! The comedy is dark, much like the tone of the movie, managing to merge a variety of writing styles into the mix to somehow offset the edge this film has. Even in the dogs there is comedy to a darker sense, but this brings up that the movie actually utilizes its character very well in this chapter. Halle Berry, McShane, even the Concierge (Lance Reddick) are utilized well in this tale, with adequate screen time and action sequences that are all relevant. The results is an expansion of the story, utilizing the background information, these relationships, and some new characters to evolve the tale even more. As such, it gives some slight relevance to the violence at hand. Yet, the biggest components to this film are the pace and the action sequences. John Wick's choreographed chaos only continues to expand, pushing past the gun play that was semi okay in chapter 2, and opens up some new styles to get your fists (and bloodlust) pumping. From nearly start to finish, there is not much down time from the carnage and if that's a movie you want... you've got it.\nYet, the movie's glorification of violence sometimes gets to levels that aren't necessary outside of appeasing that gore craving some might have. The excessive displays of death are a part of it, but this tactic is not my cup of tea without really needing it for story. In addition, though there has been expansion of the tale, there were some leads laid out that didn't quite add to anything other than what the ending sets up. It's lackluster story telling that merely seems to extend the shelf life of this revenge tale as it sets up its players for the next acts. Well either that or to provide more moments of destruction which again become a little too much at times. Often use as a running joke, John Wick 3 sometimes goes to extensive rounds just to have our guys go through some form of breakable glass. It's mostly fine, but there are several extensive sequences of just unnecessary destruction to get a laugh and extend the unrealistic moments even further. In regards, to the unrealistic moments, I understand how much fantasy there is in this series, but there are even limits in the universe that don't seem to be followed consistently. Wick's stamina and ability to bounce back from serious injuries is already incredible, but there are times where again the excessive punishment is unbelievable and the rules are redrawn for either a running joke or a god complex.\nLet's face it, John Wick 3 is all about continuing the trend of violence, action, and the dark edge that we have loved in the first two installments. New fans and old fans should dive right into the adrenaline rush, happy with the guns and hand to hand combat sequences that inhabit this movie. It's true, it's over the top and full of ridiculous moments that have made this series famous, but in this installment, they are going a little too far to push the envelope in regards to stunts, stamina, and death count. While most won't be affected, and perhaps love this component, the continued pushing of the edge is also starting to lose the balance that this once had, beginning to get to the levels that the Fast and Furious series are starting to take. Still, I really enjoyed this film, the action it brought, and all the cinema worthy stunts and special effects make it worthy of a theater visit.Overall my scores are:Action/Crime Thriller: 8.0-8.5\nMovie Overall: 7.0",

The ending requires a level of disbelief so high it ruins the experience. The twist at the end also made no sense. The ending was a terrible setup that doesn't make me want to see John Wick 4 if they make it. I purposely left out spoilers, but the biggest take away from this review is you're gonna have to suspend a massive amount of disbelief. You have to sacrifice too much realism and logic, it just doesn't work. I'm normally fine with suspending a little disbelief, I'm not unreasonable, but they went overboard in this 3rd installment. There's a few points where the enemy has full control over killing John Wick, it made no sense. They purposely showed him mercy, but not just a little mercy, it's like they wanted to be killed by John Wick, it didn't work.I still recommend watching this movie, but you'll be disappointed unless you're a master in the arts of suspending disbelief.In my opinion, if you google \"suspension of disbelief\", it should show John Wick 3 on the Wikipedia page that explains suspension of disbelief.",

With that being said, I will also say I've seen Keanu train for all that fighting and he really is that badass. I'm just glad the dog/dogs are all ok! One scene almost made me turn it off but my husband assured me all was fine and I kept watching. As unbelievable as it was, the big fight scene with the dogs was probably my favorite scene. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed all the action, but that's all the movie was. Probably wouldn't see this one again. Sorry Keanu!",

A memorable fight scene involving mirrors and daggers welcomes you towards the beginning, and they are not horsing around (wink wink) in the very next fight scene that follows. The usage of environment in the fight sequences is awesome. Towards mid movie, a couple of canines join the fight which is quite fun to watch. JW3 manages to keep the franchise fresh. In the final battle, there is quite a bit of humor infused into how things play out but not in a unearned way- just perfectly timed for a smile. It is also really well paced so you don't run into 'Fight Fatigue', it comes at all the right moments, so kudos to the editors. If you are a fan of Action and Fight movies, watch JW3 today. It will not disappoint.",

John Wick just keeps adding and expanding more and more from it's original and I believe it will be looked back at as a cult masterpiece in the future.John Wick isn't invisible. There are ennemies that are better than him or more than him and he gets hurt but he can find a way to outsmart them, usually in the most badass ways. He is a man who just wants some peace but just can't catch a break and gets dragged once again in some trouble. Trouble seems to find this man.\nOverall the vibe and the scen\nCan't wait for the fourth one\nOverall the vibe and scenery of how the movie was shot fits perfectly with the story.\nWould reccomend to anyone as one of my top picks. Can't wait for the 4th one.",

Why? because thats what they did, remember, John Wick 1 he was just a guy who wanted revenge, John Wick 2 with him tying up loose ends and causing trouble, but this one well, it expands the world a little.Its a lame way of story telling, but i'll tell you without spoiling it, know Call of Duty, where the main characters gets dropped everywhere people needs to die to the point you cannot even follow? same thing. John Wick has gone full cartoony.7/10, highest rating in a while from me, its better than most comics because it got good gory action.",

Accepting that this movie is purely fictional and that you paid to watch this one for the fun factor would make this truly entertaining!

        "text": "Prepare for war. Quite literally. Parabellum is an all out war and it shows from the opening minutes of this film. I don't know many people who don't like Keanu Reeves as the stylish assassin John Wick. Well, we've now got a trilogy on our hands which was always the plan. The first two films are very fun and stylish action heavy films. Expect more of the same with the third installment, but somehow its all jacked up. This was a splendid time in the cinema due to its neon aura and relentless fight scenes.The film takes place after the events of Chapter 2. John Wick is on the run and there is a bounty on his head for 15 million. John Wick is an obviously capable hitman but new forces led by a woman nicknamed The Adjudicator prove to be a difficult enemy. Wick must rely on old friends and partners to escape those who want him dead. A lot of the former cast do return for this film with the addition of Halle Berry and Asia Kate Dillon. In all essences its a direct continuation of the second film.Balls to the wall action. its beautifully choreographed. The action scenes are so crisp and sharp. Its all so violent an fast and occurs on different terrains. Guns, knives, hand to hand combat, you got it all. The scenes look gorgeous with the night city lights and the brightly lit up neon lights. There's not much to go on with story but really the reason we are all here is for the incredible fight scenes. On that front, you get everything you came for. Its a long film but really is a fun watch as the film moves along with its fast paced action.The film is series building, I was hoping they would end it with a trilogy but there seems to be more on its way. Reeves is great in this and really excels as Wick. He still has his cheesy lines and is as intuitive as ever in the battles. Chad Stahelski has seriously mastered this series and has found a way to make it better and still feel as fresh as ever. Bring on the crazy, this film is madness. If you like the other two you will love this one for sure.8/10",

No spoilers here but they've really amped up the action on this one and the story delves a bit deeper into the mythos of John Wick himself.One thing that amazes me is the many negative reviews on here, surely if your going to watch this film your going to have watched the 1st 2 instalments what did you expect from the 3rd??The 1st 2 films were all guns and visceral violence why did you expect the 3rd to be any different??If amazes me that these so called reviewer's have watched the 1st 2 films and they thought the 3rd was gonna be different somehow, people banging on about no story this film had more of a story than both of the 2 preceding it.Anyway if you've made it down this far as I appreciate there's almost 2000 or so reviews above me if u like John wick 1 and 2 then your going to love this one as I did.If you didn't enjoy the first 2 films then don't watch this one and certainly don't review it negatively expecting something different that's just idiotic lol. Just enjoy the film for what it is another action packed rollercoaster ride.reviewstalker101 out.",

        "text": "I know that he's an acquired taste, but I happen to enjoy Keanu Reeves as an actor. Not much in the sense that he's a character player, but he knows how to present himself and bolster his masculinity. He falls into the same category of John Wayne, Lee Marvin and Yul Brynner, these are actors that tend to play action roles more as they understand that their fans want to see them and not another character. Does that mean the movie belongs to them and not the story? I would say it depends on what message the movie's trying to get across.Looking at the John Wick movies, their goal isn't to teach the audience a lesson. They're there to watch a seemly likable man kill mafia people after killing his dog and steeling his car. But there's also a lot we don't know about the character other then he's really good at what he does. The other draw is that even though the guy seems unkillable, he has some history and people that openly fear him, giving him a bit more credibility to his existence. The first two were two fun action movies and the tradition continues with John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum.After what happened in John Wick: Chapter 2, John Wick (Played by Keanu Reeves) finds himself excommunicated from his agency and has a fourteen-million dollar bounty for his head. After several people try to kill him, he manages to escape into sanctuary-like theater where a woman called \"The Director\" (played by Anjelica Huston), agrees to get him to Casablanca, Morocco. At the same time, a group called the High Table sends the \"Adjustor\" (played by Asia Kate Dillon) to the Continental Hotel, a place where John had been receiving help and supplies over the years. She tries to get hotel owner and manager Winston (played by Ian McShane) to step down, but he refuses.When John Wick gets to Casablanca, he finds an assassin and friend Sofia (Played by Halle Berry) where he asks on how to find the Elder, one of the only people that can get the bounty off of hid head. His journey takes him through Morocco, the Desert and eventually back to New York where along with continuing to run into other assassins, the High Table hires a ninja Zero (played by Mark Dacascos) and his group to try and take out John Wick.Unlike some \"three\" movies in other franchises, John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum continues to raise the stakes and makes for a really fun movie. The best movie I can compare this to is Mad Max: Furry Road where the whole thing feels like a rush. Just when then main character thinks he can catch a breath, more people keep coming at him and it's entertaining to see just how much Keanu Reeves can take.The action is never boring thanks to it's creative kills (whether it's a hundreds knives thrown, using horses to kick people to death, or samurai swords on motorcycles)\nThe story also works fine. The goal of this guy is to stay alive and it doesn't need much convincing to do so. I do like seeing how far the villains will go to see this guy dead and the people they'll talk to. It can sometimes go on too long, making some of the dialogue parts drawn out. I'd say the middle of the movie is where it almost starts to go off track as much of it is finding how John Wick is going to live and how the High Table sends who after him.Before it can make any mistakes, it's climax and third act to pick up and make everything exciting again. It takes everything that it builds and lets it loose in an explosive finale with guns, swords, and classic martial arts. I won't spoil how things end, but it does set up for a sequel. This is something that not only would I love, but I'd guarantee I'd be the first in line at my theater.I'll give this nine blood markers out of ten. Though you don't need to see the first two to enjoy this, I'd recommend doing so to get an idea with the kind of world this sets up. John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is the kind of fun I'd expect out of a summer blockbuster, especially in contrast to the more superhero-fueled Avengers: Endgame.",

I didn't like it and I couldn't actually see the hunter nature of John Wick, in which he acts wildly but also with precision. Also I don't think the fight scenes were that spectacular, I didn't like the camera angles or the choreography of the fights which I think is a huge downside for move it like this which is composed of 80% action. I think he lacks character that he had in the first movie and I am very surprised that this movie was rated an 8 on IMDb.",

It's also crazy to me that at his age Keanu Reeves, still pulls off most of his stunts. To be fair if he didn't do his own stunts he'd literally do nothing. He has very little lines. I'm definitely going to be watching the 4th one. I find it a bit annoying that they announced there was going to be 5 of them years a go because you already know how each film is going to end. What I mean by that is you know he's not going to die and it's going to lead into the next film. They should say there's going to be another after the film has come out.",

The good news: the action sequences (which are the whole point of this series, honestly) are spectacular...the best fight sequences in the entire franchise. The bad news: the characters talk much more than Parts 1 and 2 too. And while there's value to building mythology here, the movie feels a little less tight and Wick's actions make a little less sense. This saga works best when the story is told via kicks and gunshots...not dialogue. Still, the good outweighs the talking, and it is hard to take your eyes away. I'll be back for Chapter 4, even if I hope there's a little less talking next time around.",

The movie simply assumes you watched the first two and starts from there, no explanation given (if you didn't, go and watch them before). And starts with intense, brutal action, and simply keeps building. No time was wasted on explanations, or detailed character development, even for new ones like Halle Berry.Trully a masterpiece of excitement, if you love good action. I did not even see the 2 hours go by. Avengers was a 3 hour movie, but had less than 1 third of action.

The rest is insultingly bad.If this film stopped at half of its ludicrous action and overblown settings, it might be seen as a parody. But at this length you can only conclude that there was no taste, judgement, or vision involved - just mindless formula carried to extremes.Reeves better have medical coverage for repetitive stress injuries. And, until they offer that for viewers too, don't take the risk.",

It's still the same as what it always was to begin with - a superficial, over stylised, over-choreographed blockbuster which sadly increases in its artificial \"artfulness\" with each contrived addition to the first.",

It's not like this is the 3rd movie or anything. I also love the \"worst movie I ever watched\" ones. If this is the worst movie you've ever seen, you must have led a sheltered existence.

I hope that those people have a break so that they can find the best ideas for a second trilogy. Unfortunately, this movie will help Avatar stay on top, a complex action movie and a gorgeous screenplay, find out John Wick's real home and see how he was physically injured twice, and the second which was brutal and unexpected (I am referring to the end of the film) I was shocked and satisfied because now he has another reason to take revenge.",

Some silly stuff like John picks up bad guy's guns and has clips in his pockets to reload them all. Also, his friend never runs out of dogs? Overall a good effort.

        "text": "The very first John Wick is a good film, even though it looses its grip towards the end, still a fearsome assassin returning from retirement because he's been wronged is a great premise for an action film. The second one was absolute trash, in my review I said it was like watching the director play call of duty .. you know where if you are hit with bullets/knives, you can hide behind a barrel and re-emerge scratch-less or find a cheat code which gives you unlimited ammo and medi-packs. That film was exactly a video game, not an adaption or a based-on type .. but just a video game with live actors. In fact, if you will play the future Cyberpunk game, which also stars Reeves in it, you will find it exactly like JW2 .. And now, coming to the third one .. again it is the same mind-less, sense-less super-hero action video game with cheat codes for unlimited ammo, body armour and medi-packs! I mean come on, everyone from the street beggar to highly trained assassins galore wants to kill John Wick and he outdoes them for the entire duration of the film. I mean come on, how easy would it be for a sniper to take down the Wick when he is wrestling in open street?? What..all of a sudden the elite trained assassins syndicate do not have snipers or machine guns??And I rightfully call this a superhero flick as only, probably Superman would survive when you have hoards of assassins lunging at you with guns, chains, swords and what not whist JW defends himself with a pencil!! Yes, this movie is as ridiculous as the words which I just used to describe it. Yet, all folks here decided to give it an 8 star rating!! I struggled to understand how this can be and then it hit me, drinking is the most favourite thing in the world, statistically! If it were ok and free, we probably would consume more alcohol than water!! And with such stats, this film would look like a perfect 10 when you are totally, over-the-head intoxicated. There mystery solved!!I need to talk about the few good bits as well. I cannot put down the man Reeves. If you look at his training videos for this film, he really puts everything he's got into it! Plus he is the one super-nice celeb when that genre doesn't exist in our world! He really should be every guys role-model. And that perfect training shows in few action sequences which are simply brilliant! Wish someone puts some sense into the script and makes the 4th instalment at least to be on par with the first one!",

Long shots of numerous fights with different weapons look very impressive and beautiful. It seems to me that this film is perhaps the best in the trilogy in this regard. However, the story is the worst and there are a lot of characters who look secondary and have only less minutes in the film. If you are looking for \"only\" bloody action and shooting, then this will be a great movie for you.",

It's fun if you love fight scenes that go on and on, it's not so good if you like your movie to have a plot. The Continental is still a cool concept, and Ian McShane and Lance Reddick still rule in their roles at that establishment. The fact that almost everyone in NYC is now somehow connected to the place seems pretty far fetched. But again, if you like extended, fast-paced fight scenes, some with amazing dogs, this is your film. For me, I think 20 to 30 minutes of those fights could be edited out, and nothing would have been different.",

The movie starts fast with almost non-stop action with great visuals, well-choreographed fight scenes, shootouts and amazing cinematography and slowly calms down by the end - John gets tired and the movie tires along with him. The third act has divided my overall opinion on the whole John Wick's franchise - on one hand it's still one of the greatest action flicks of the new millenium and Keanu Reeves, being well after fifty, puts all of his cards on the table despite having almost zero dialogue in the movie - and that's what makes him John \"In No Way\" Weak but on the other hand this movie is an old and rusted nail to the coffin of the franchise because it makes a superhero out of a main hero. He's indestructible, he's a war machine, he's a Terminator but at least you can kill a Terminator but not John. And that's what disappoints the most - by the middle of the movie you realize that other people actually aren't that eager to kill him after all. The \"superhero\" cancer has already murdered John McClane and John Rambo, I wish it wouldn't finish John Wick too.\nOverall I enjoyed the movie, its occasional humor, remarkable action, Keanu's fine performance and the supporting Laurence Fishburne whose delivery of the character was simply outstanding.",

I can feel this franchise coming to an end or altering radically to rejuvenate, while still on a high, a very interesting proposition indeed.",

Never have so many people wanted to kill a single man as with the lead characters every single breath there's a goon waiting in every corner. Keanu Reeves is his usual hammy and ungainly self as he limps his way into one fistfight, gunfight and chase where it's not sufficient to put one bullet into a man's head, you have to put five. One tedious fight scene follows another tedious fight scene as if to compensate for this non-story. And of course, the obligatory pc insertion is in full display: the multiracial cast, the tough all-knowing black chick lording it over the white guy while kicking the a** of every man who dares breathe the same air she does. A blockbuster hit upon its release, this is one tolerable seat-squirmer that'll fade into the mists of time.",

No one he killed after that deserved to die.This movie is the worst of all.\nThe plot is all over the place, no reason for anything and the missions so meaningless I feel I can only say urgh.\nPeople are not cool just because they don't smile. They are cool cos they have abilities normal people do not have. Yet everyone just acts cool with nothing to back them up, yes, I know you have guns and suits and knives, everyone has them.\nEveryone respects John Wick, but as far as I see, there is no reason to. He is just a murderer with no honour.Again I have to repeat. No substance. Just alot of hot air.",

This is one of those movies that is relies on action to make it good movie and that's probably the reason why other people don't like the movie, but if you're a fan of action-packed movies, you should definitely watch this. Also, I'm a bit disappointed as I assumed this was the last movie of the franchise and I was expecting a conclusion; Oh well, I guess I'll have to wait for John Wick 4 in 2021, unless they decide to carry on which will be a bit annoying to be honest.",

BUt also there too many pulled punches, kicks, and too many obvious added moves and reactions that seemed to be horrendously choreographed.\nI may not be the greatest fighter or even close to it, but I still have eyes.\nThis film tried to do too much. Slowly the movies have kinda told the story of John Wick, piece by bloody piece and it would have seemed well done if not for the endless charade of back and forth contract to contract rescinded and same old gun battles. Dont get me wrong, there were some parts I enjoyed, and my imagination flared at the prospect of seeing ninjas or descendants of middle eastern assassins or whatever. But it was not to be, and was just a bit too hollow. BUt enjoy, its just a gun fest. Nothing more. 6/10",

The kill count is not as obscene as the second, but it's still a little unbelievable... literally.I do appreciate the different combat aspects they are trying, such as John fighting all types of people whether they're super tall, big, small, heavily armored, or basically ninjas. The inclusion of animals from horses to dogs was really unique too.As the viewer we get a bigger glimpse into this criminal underworld, and how it all operates. Seeing front desk attendant Charon in action was very welcomed.Bring on Chapter 4.",

And the specific fight/gore humor is at the same sadistic level as in previous movies. They might even push it up a notch or two.If you are a fan of the previous John Wick movies. Go watch it. You will not be disappointed. I feel I am a bit spoiled with the epic proportions of the Avengers last movie. So I am bit tempted to rate it less than 10.

And no John Wick, I will not be coming for the fourth,fifth whatever chapter. So final thoughts, 0 story, with that story the actors couldn't do much so you can add bad acting to the mix and lots of action, after the first half John is so bad at fighting his enemies are waiting for him to enter the fight.",

The bike fight scene was a bit much. Halle Berry's character is a good addition to the story and she looks stunning for her age. Zero's character is also entertaining. Parabellum ends on another sour note for John Wick. Throughout the series, its gotten more and more difficult for John Wick to leave the assassin world and lead a normal life. So, John Wick 4 has got to be interesting.Since the John Wick series necessarily has femme fatale characters in it, it is my wish to see Milla Jovovich in it at some point. That would be killer if it happens!One thing I've noticed in me after watching the John Wick films is that I find it difficult to enjoy heavy CGI based fight scenes in movies now. Beware!",

The only reason I downgraded it a point was I felt they were trying to introduce to many unnecessary characters. There is a decent scene with Wick fighting with a Halle Berry character but I like Wick on his own, last man standing type thing. Her cameo was unnecessary. Looking forward already to number 4.

As good as ever.\n-The Realism? Just a tiny bit lacking from the first two films. Though the fighting was fluid and definitely believable as it was pulled off by a relative master that's been through the training, there were a few moments where it was clear they sacrificed a bit of realism for spectacle. In John Wick 1 and 2, you could believe that someone could pull off everything that John did if they were a good enough master. But in JW3, there's a few instances(very minor) where the enemies definitely should have killed John if they had even half the competence of some of the lower grunts from earlier movies. And John takes a heavier beating in this film (though is that a surprise when the world is after him with a 14m bounty?) yet somehow recovers enough to win when the same enemies he was facing were just putting him through the ringer.Overall, a solid follow up.",

John wick 3 was about surviving and killing. there was really no plot to begin with.See, you can have an action movie with a stupid plot with no character development whatsoever and STILL be entertaining to sit through. An action film should still be borderline realistic. Even those old school kung fu movies where guys fly around and do magical doo doo stuff was more entertaining because they were well choreographed at least.That wouldn't have been a problem if the fight and gun combo scenes were meticulously choreographed here. Instead they were very bad and felt rushed. This one managed to get it all, the bad cgi blood, the endless spawning of bad guys that would only appear random times that made no sense, the 100 lbs woman kicking ass against 200 lbs men that are trained to kill at some point doesn't reload...damn how many rounds do you have on you girl?The fight scenes were the worst. John wick seems to block the punches that weren't thrown yet or was just about to be thrown. You can see him pull his punches as to not hurt the stunt guys! punches looked like he was swatting flies of the bad guys face.Then, if you are surrounded by killers best to do many flashy jujitsu moves before killing 1 guy? well I guess its because they were waiting for their turn to move eh?

I swear Keanu Reeves just gets better and better the older he gets, and that's an incredible feat to behold since a majority of actors lose their touch over the years. The thing about Keanu Reeves is he always seems to suit every movie he's in. He is the quiet and introverted type, and lets be honest he has never possessed the emotional range we all crave when it comes to great acting, but Keanu has found a way to bypass this with his cool chilled out personality and the ability to look as cool as possible with almost anything he does. The Matrix for example was a perfect casting choice for him with the introverted nature of the character of Neo who breaks out of his shell and becomes one of the coolest badass characters of the 90s, though I always wonder what it might have been like If Will Smith took the role in an alternate timeline, but that we will never know.......... or could we (Vsauce music plays)Anyway, this movie was a blast from start to finish, and lets be honest. Will Smith could not have pulled of the sheer style of Keanu's choreography in this movie. Noone can play the character of John Wick better then Reeves..... Well maybe Chuck Norris, maybeAnyway, this movie was a blast and was so expertly shot and directed with a cerebral and engaging story full of stunning sequences of kinetic combat that Wick fans have grown to love. This has to be thee most interesting action trilogy that emerged from 2010s cinema, like many things, it kind of just came out of nowhere slowly growing in it's prescence until it becomes so large that you can't ignore it anymore, and this trilogy sure did bring some first class action with it's own unique style and mode of execution, and then in a matter of a few years, it's overIt is sad that this is the last film in the franchise since I found myself really enjoying just exactly what these films had to offer. But the one thing I am certain about is that Reeves still has a lot of spark left in him, growing even better and more mature as time goes on. I'm feeling that even better films are coming around the corner for him as his career seems to be only ramping up from here",

Really wish they had cast someone else.\nAnyway, this movie wasn't nearly as enjoyable as the first 2 installments but was still watchable as an action flick. Halle Berry's dogs may have been the best part.",

        "text": "John Wick Chapter 3 proves that this franchise is still going strong. Here are the negatives. Some lines of dialogue feel kind of weird. Asia Kate Dillon's performance felt really wooden and she never showed a lot of emotion. There are sequences where John Wick and another character are talking and all of a sudden they start talking in a different language and then switch back to English. It does start to get annoying. My last problem would be that I think Halle Berry was way underused. Here are the positives. Keanu Reeves does a fantastic job. He has done an outstanding job in each of these films but he did a lot better in this one. Laurence Fishburne and Halle Berry also do a fantastic job. The rest of the supporting cast does a great job. The standout for all the John Wick movies is the action. It's no different here. The action is awesome. It's hard to believe that Keanu Reeves is actually doing all of these stunts. The John Wick movies are basically 2 hours of dumb fun action. Each fight scene has some sort of unique flare to it that makes the scene interesting to watch. The cinematography is pretty good in this film also. Each action scene is shot differently and it makes those scenes ten times cooler. There is a cool long take action scene on a bridge. The score for the film is good. It's not outstanding, it's just good. The story is interesting also. We get to learn a lot more about where John Wick learned to fight and it's very interesting. There are a couple of jokes that did manage to get a chuckle or two out of me. The locations used in this film are really cool such as Casablanca and New York City. It's good to see these different environments in this film. The film is paced really well and the tone remains consistent most of the time. Before you see this film, you must watch the first two John Wick films or you will be confused. Overall, John Wick Chapter 3 - Parabellum provides more hard hitting action with great acting and solid worldbuilding. I give John Wick Chapter 3 - Parabellum an 8/10.",

Unfortunately real content is largely lacking in JW3, and I left unsatisfied and frustrated that such an opportunity went wasted.The storyline is spread quite thin, no twists, nothing remarkable at all.\nWhat can be said is there's a lot of fighting. That is, a lot of the same thing. Over and over. Boring. And it's just plain stupid to believe that so many bullets are flying around and only baddies die. Adding killer dogs is a nice try but did not help much to up the antics. I just couldn't buy into any of it.\nAnd then that end scene that is SO forced and utterly pathetic. It has cheap B-rated movie all over it. Seriously..\nThen better give me Denzel's The Equalizer, with less but more thought-through action, a story that actually goes somewhere, and an actor that brings across some intelligence and is capable of more than just creating lethal holes in bad guys.\nTo each his own....",

I don't know why either because it's not like you really need to understand these movies. Does anyone see John Wick for the story? However, coming back to America I soon realize that a story that started out with a man and his dead dog and stolen car turns out to be more complicated than we thought.So now John Wick is on the run and everywhere he goes, someone wants to kill him. The first half of the movie is pure action. There's some amazing set pieces and you will be entertained throughout the movie. I just don't know what's up with this high council stuff and betrayals. Not only that, but the movie is somewhat cliched and predictable which is too bad, because the John Wick series should never be cliched and predictable.Like I said, the action scenes are great and the main Chinese guy chasing him was great. I'm not sure why Halle Berry is in this movie other than to give John Wick somebody to interact with.The film is a good time and there's going to be a fourth one. I'll be seeing that too.",

        "text": "Once upon a time, an almost washed out star Keanu Reeves, and a stunt director Chad Stahelski met and agreed that Hollywood needs to get one up on Oriental cinema with for usurping the action category crown martial arts extravaganzas such as The Raid, The Raid 2, Ong Bak, The Man from Nowhere, Ip-Man and Tom-Yum-Goong.Minimum plot, maximum action- they decided, and out came John Wick in 2014. The movie practically invented a new action genre- gun fu. With 91 onscreen kills, and $88 million at the box office, there was no looking back. John Wick 2 released in 2017- had 119 confirmed onscreen kills and made $170 million at the box office. The numbers do not look like much, but consider the R-ratings, low budgets and critical acclaim, it is only natural that John Wick is here to entertain us again, with a kill count in the range of 170.\"Si vis pacem, para bellum\" - translates to if you want peace, prepare for war.Parabellum starts right where John Wick 2 ended. Wick is on the run in New York after being excommunicated by the High Table, and a bounty of $14 million is placed on his head. Cue to start of kill count. If John Wick 2 showed what he could do with a pencil, Parabellum shows what John can do with a book. He follows that up with a knife fight that sets up the action theme for the movie. Blades, lots of them all around, even though John prefers guns, lots of guns.\nWick has very few options and friends left, who in turn incur the wrath of the High Table too. the action quickly shifts to scenic Casablanca, where he elicits the help of fellow assassin Sofia. The two good things about Sofia are her two Malinois, and that she is played by Halle Berry, who makes finally makes us forget her action turn in Catwoman with a scene stealing act. Stahelski also goes one step further and invents- you got it, dog fu. They go for your \"soft spots\". Watch it to believe it.Like it's predecessors, the plot can be summed up in one line- John Wick kills everybody.However, as the series got bigger with every installment, Stahelski and Reeves continue to introduce new characters, and expand the Wicki-verse. In that process we also get to know John better and better. In John Wick 2, we got to know John knows sign language and Italian. In this one, we get to know he is originally Russian (Jovonovich= John Wick), he can speak Indonesian, and he knows there exists a higher power than the High Table. Staying true to the what the fans want, John duly dispatches every assassin who comes up against him in inventive style- guns and knives are passe, this time we have horse mule kicks, samurai swords, wacky motorbike chases, and that book! John Wick is so awesome that even his enemies go all giggly and blabbermouth in front of him.Zero: \"I've been a huge fan forever, and so far you haven't disappointed\"Keanu may not be a natural action star but he goes about his duties with an unmatched earnestness. Stahelski proves yet again that he is a master at framing visceral action shots. He is also great at casting- Mark Dacascos makes a welcome comeback as Zero, the sushi-chef assassin, while the Indonesian silat experts Yayan Ruhian and Cecep Arif Rahman do justice to the best fight sequence in the film.The scale might be getting bigger than it should, the ending appeared forced, and the new characters not interesting enough anymore. But there is no denying that John Wick 3 is a martial arts masterpiece, and that Keanu Reeves has miles to go when it comes to the onscreen kill count scale. Jimmy Wang Yu is currently sitting pretty at 2477.So I say, keep going at it, Keanu.",

Aherm unlike the 2nd pile of garbage.Story:\nOkay now the story was fairly interesting and kept me watching. Very fun gun/fight scenes and it was overall an incredible improvement over the 2nd film. The 2nd film was all leading up to this one and it did just that. I did find some scenes a bit unrealistic or lame, like john having to walk across a desert and mysteriously gets found before his death.. yeah that was super lame. But overall a good plot.Summary:\nThis is a huge improvement from john wick 2 which I absolutely hated. But not as good as john wick 1, which In itself is going to be quite iconic for a long time. I would suggest this film as its still got the flare the 1st one had, just a worse story which isnt too bad.",

        "text": "Having not seen the first two installments of the John Wick series, it's clear I missed out on a few key plot points, such as Anjelica Houston's origin story or what kind of table the Table is, and why people are obsessed with being over it or under it. I also missed the John Wick origin story, but that gets quite cleared up quite quickly when he visits Anjelica Houston (The Director) at the Belarus embassy somewhere near the Bowery, probably take the A train to get there.In a world filled with professional assassins, one might expect a lot of assassinations, but instead we get a lot of attempted assassinations, some with guns, some with knives, some with fists, and some with library books. We also get some fun tips of the hats to other movies. Although surely not comprehensive, what follows is the list I came up with while phasing in and out of consciousness at the theater.One, a quick shot of Buster Keaton on The General on a big screen in Times Square. I think this is an homage to those who performed their own physical stunts, however dangerous, such as Buster Keaton, Tom Cruise, Keanu Reeves, and Imogene Coca. What I wonder, though, is how would Keaton's original audiences have responded to John Wick's blasé faire attitude towards ammunition conservation. Armor-piercing shells are rare!Two, a scene at an armory where John Wick disassembles some revolvers and creates his own bespoke heater, which must surely be a reference to Eli Wallach as Tuco in the Good, the Bad and the Ugly. If so, Nice Job Award goes to director Chad Stahelski. If not, whoopsie!Three, the entire last third preoccupied in the New York Continental Hotel is likely a reference to Hotel Artemis, except John Wick is the far better movie with far more entertaining action sequences. Take that, Jodie Foster!Fourth, a slighter reference to Game of Death, and the literal levelling-up stairs to fight harder enemies, with a fun twist of falling back a level or two and having to get back up to do it all over again. Bruce Lee, cinema still misses you!Fifth, we have a clever reimagery of the Hall of Mirrors from Enter the Dragon, except Ian McShane indicates a strong preference for tempered glass over mirrors, as well as staring at chess pieces which he never moves. Good thing that glass is tempered, Mr. Wick!Sixth, and likely not final, a cleverly placed nod to Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, because the Hall of Tempered Glass has a grip of crystal skulls, likely as a reminder that Steven Spielberg, in fact, made a movie so bad that it made people forget about 1941 for a minute or two. Hollywood!If, as The Director says, \"Art is pain; life is suffering,\" 0ne should always wear a nice leather belt, because you never know when you'll end up in a video game.",

My biggest complaint is that the story is just much of the same as the previous outings, but with greater danger, tougher bad guys, bigger and better weapons etc etc.This is more of a direct sequel to John Wick 2, rather than a new story, similar to what the Wachowski's did with Matrix Reloaded and Matrix Revolutions. The way they have ended John Wick 3, there is definitely going to be a fourth, which has now been confirmed.Whilst this film is a lot of fun and keeps you interested all the way through. I hope the fourth has a little more originality and if we're lucky, closure on John Wick...franchises can't keep going on forever without major adjustments.",

        "text": "The first two films in the series were great. If you go back and watch the first John Wick, there are a few silly moments in which the movie takes itself a tad bit to seriously. The second film nails the tone. It is serious and suspenseful when when servicing the action, but also supplies a much needed dose of comedic relief (especially during the ending). The third film however, takes a turn for the worst. If you watch a film specifically for brutal violence and often incredibly silly action sequences, this is a film for you. This is all the film has to offer. After seeing the ending of the second film, while fitting for that movie, I was afraid that it was a testing screen for what they could begin to do with the franchise. I didn't want the third film to suck, but unfortunately, I was right. John Wick 3 is full of action sequences that suffer from the invincible protagonist dilemma, incredibly misplaced humor (during action sequences), and a worn out action duet trope. It is literally the last thing I wanted to see from this franchise. I thought a soft goal of the first two films was to redefine action movies, but here we regress to the tired and endlessly boring tropes of action movie flops from the last few decades.",

He is not very fast like the traditional Asian martial artists; yet he is just so un-friggin-believable. And that's what the whole John Wick franchise rests upon so heavily; Crazy and impeccably well choreographed fight sequences (Which is like a symphony of sorts for a martial artist buff like me) and Keanu performing them. Like a breeze.\nThe 3rd installment of the Baba Yaga (John Wick) universe titled Parabellum (simply means 'Prepare for War') takes us a little deeper into the world of assassins and the High table (The global underworld) which was touched upon in the 2nd part. The movie begins right where the 2nd film wrapped up. John wick is the most wanted Man in the world with a booty of 14 Mn USD on his life. And he evades that. He kills his way through countless number of master assassins to stay alive. The body, blade and bullet count here will drive you nuts.\nThe world of the continental and the High table gets a lot more alluring with the addition of a few more characters and locations. We are introduced to 'The elder one' who is above the High Table who has his base in the deserts of Morocco. Then there is an adjudicator. Well, who adjudicates. And we are introduced to a manager of the Continental Morocco (Halle Berry, Sophia). That apart from the old characters. The Dog. Winston and ofcourse, the Doctor.\nParabellum goes all Guns blazing with it's extreme action choreography; something Chad Stahelski loves to do. The writing is crisp keeping in mind the subtle humour and minimal dialogue for Mr. Wick.\nThere are horses, dogs, bikes, swords, knives and ofcourse, armour piercing shot gun rounds. Several East Asian guys are added to the mix to offer us mouth watering and awe inspiring fight sequences. And Mr. Wick kicks ass. You can't help but go bonkers about Keanu Reeves.\nThis is also a reunion of sorts for The Matrix team.\nThe climax is deliciously twisted to keep everyone guessing.\nAs the movie comes to an end, the words of Mr. Wick from the 2nd film keep lingering around; 'Tell them. Tell them all. I will kill them all'.\npsk",

        "text": "While I loved the first one, and liked the 2nd & 3rd ones, the suspension of disbelief is just getting absurd.As for the good, I liked the choreographed fights, much like the first two movies, this does not disappoint. They continue to deliver great action sequences, keeping it fresh & interesting, and while most of the time honoring round amounts and gun reloading, to the point of it being comical and of course perfectly timed.Now as far as the bad... Again I understand one has to suspend a lot of disbelief and just go with it, after all it is an action movie right? But that said, there are a collection of things that just bug me, like there are assassins literally everywhere, much like the 2nd movie, it seems like half the population are assassins. Also, there is never any police, ever... I mean how can all out war happen with literally armies of assassins yet there's not a single police or military involvement whatsoever? In fact it's almost comical how deaths in public places don't even seem to trigger general panic or anything. Some aspects in the fight sequences are a little scripted looking, like people waiting for their queue or some time sync issues, but these were few for the most part few. OMG the adjudicator, both the actor and the character just annoyed the heck out of me.However probably the biggest issue for me is all 3 movies literally take place within a week's time span. And we already saw from the first two movies he gets shot, cut, and takes numerous punishment throughout, and the 3rd movie is no different. Yet he still has the strength and stamina to keep pulling through which just defies all physical boundaries. I mean in the real world, you don't just get stabbed or shot, stitch it up & pop some pain killers and keep on fighting on like nothing happened, you'd bleed out within minutes. Not only that in pretty much all his fights he takes punishment, yet there is no accumulation of damage, no swelling or slowdown, heck it never even looks like he's breathing hard. I realize it's supposed to be a fast paced movie, but I just think it would be great if they actually added a bit of realism to it, maybe add in the occasional quick rest scene. It just gets to be a bit mechanical and absurdIn the end, it is mindless entertainment, I know they are working on a 4th one and I'll see it of course",

        "text": "This is the third chapter in a franchise that appears to be trying to justify its continuance vice tell a story. Chapter one was the beginning, where a character is taken out of his happy place by a random death combined with a reconnection to the seedy side of life he once was a part of. Chapter two was that seedy life selfishly forcing him back in against his will, culminating in the character destroying some of the self-serving laws of that evil society.Chapter three was thought to be the culminating event, where the character has the seedy side declare war upon him, and he has to defeat the seedy sub-world.Instead, the third chapter was a set up, a brief and altogether threadbare glimpse into the so-called \"High Table,\" that orchestrates the rules of this underworld for its own selfish benefit. The movie title is the literal explanation for this third chapter, in that John Wick is merely preparing for war against the High Table.We merely see Wick knock off a bunch of foot soldiers and a couple of underlings. A movie cannot justify its entire purpose with senseless violence, regardless of the production quality, and so the effort seems shallow.Perhaps the fourth movie finally completes the quite obvious story. But, that story frankly could have been told in chapter three. Someone appears to have put commercial interests above the storytelling, and it would seem many fans walked away thinking they paid for half a loaf vice the whole thing.Exposing the outfit known as the High Table, and having their evil world crash down upon them, would have been a dynamic and interesting story, but we only get a set up in this installment. One hopes the pressure to get on with that story dominates the agenda in chapter four.",

        "text": "'John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum' isn't as good as the first two 'Wick flicks', primarily due to its narrative. People often complain about the story of 'John Wick (2014)', citing that it is far too simple and just an afterthought to aid the action, but in my opinion it's very effective one that creates a great world and characters. Indeed, 'John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017)' continued this excellent world-building, crafting an engaging story in its own right as well. In its climax, it promised an non-stop, action-filled survival story for the third entry. Obviously, that would have been too much action and too little plot, so in this third film there is a great attempt to keep the narrative evolving throughout. Unfortunately, this can definitely be felt and for the first time in the series, it truly does feel like the story only exists to get John from A to B so that another action scene can take place. Therefore, the narrative doesn't feel as natural as in the other two and it's doing way less character work. Make no mistake though, while it's not as good as it's predecessors on the narrative front, it's still fully engaging throughout and you do care about the eponymous hero. This time around, it's just far more concerned about its action. Thankfully then, this is definitely the most action heavy of the three, and it fully delivers on that front. It's exhilarating and wonderfully inventive stuff, somehow managing to keep momentum up throughout every sequence. From books to horses, John makes use of just about every item you can think of in the wonderfully choreographed and performed fight sequences, which solidify the franchise as one of the absolute best Hollywood action series' of all time. With a fourth film already announced, however, I'm a little sceptical that they're going to be able to keep it up moving forward. It's going to be hard to top the action scenes in this one and, like I said, the story is already beginning to run its course. But whatever the future of the series holds, every entry so far has been excellent, with this one being no exception.

The viewer knows from the onset that the protagonist is going to go through lots of ordeals, but will eventually prevail.And then there you have a sheer endless martial arts circus and CGI-enhanced manslaughter between the first and the last minute. Blood, on the other hand, maybe in an attempt to make the carnage family safe, is excluded. The tiny amount spilled is dark, desaturated and mostly CGI.I am yet to see another movie as pointless as this. This one marks so far the lowest point in Keanu Reeves's career.",

John Wick 2 somewhat upped the action, but the plot couldnt've possibly been on the level as 1 had a definitive ending. I viewed 2's plot as something that needed to be sacrificed for a franchise and that's exacly what we got. But, now with the 3, I'm not sure where said francise will go if it sacrifices it's plot any further.As happy as I am that action is better than ever, the plot problems seep into it as well, resulting in an uneven pacing and unclear character motivation as well as some plot holes holding this movie back from being something truly excellent like the original.I still find it better than 2 overall, but not by much.",

The scene with knives is the most cruel sequence in whole trilogy. There is nothing to say about Keanu Reeves, he puts his everything and he is just incredible. Also I liked new characters. On the other hand I have just two problems with this movie. One of them is its length. Sometimes fighting scenes becomes boring because they are so intense and so long, thats tiring for audience. And the other is it has an unrealistic final but it is a kind of mysterious too. We can understand that fourth movie will be released in few years, Im excited about it. Finally, I can easily say this trilogy is so impressive because it is telling a story which is happening in just one week. It has great dynamics and I want to see the ending of John Wick's journey in next movie.",

Of course, the story of an assassin that wants to rest is not new, but the universe of the killers with the rules followed under the threat of death and astonishing love for the action of an exquisite quality has put 'John Wick' way over other stories.Keanu Reeves shows no fatigue and no desire to stop. The reels of him preparing for the role look like he genuinely has to clash with all those hitmen. This level of dedication opens the doors for the amazing continuous shots that keep your attention tight as the dog keeps the jaws on its target. Speaking of the dogs, Halle Berry brought some delight appearing and reminded of her capabilities to skillfully throw some fists and the mashup with her devoted pets brought new rush into the combat elegance. The choreography leaves no words - you keep watching ingenious ways to kill people, the gunfights are improving more and more, however, after the second part I didn't know that it was possible. Surprisingly 'Parabellum' offers you fun and exciting turns that justify its uniqueness.Rewinding everything that I saw makes me scold the movie for artificial plot steering. Throughout the whole film we see that hero gets the window of opportunity too many times: like somebody stands behind the curtains and screams to his opponents: \"Give in! We need him for the next chapter!\"Putting the gun aside I will say that the expectations to see Keanu Reeves kick a lot of asses are fulfilled to the maximum. I wasn't going on it for the plot and over 70% of the movie just gave me top quality action that quenched my adrenaline thirst while giving tons of laughs and insights on the mysterious world of assassins.",

        "text": "Keanu Reeves stars in his third iteration of many's favorite movie hitman, John Wick. It feels like a long time coming for this movie but the franchise picks up as if they never left us. The only person who left us in this series was Michael Nyqvist, who as signature villain in the first John Wick movie. There is a nice tribute to him in the credits after the movie.But now it's time to take a shot at Baba Yaga.YOU KNOW WHY YOU'RE WATCHING THIS MOVIE. John Wick does two things very well: kill assassins and get the mess beat out of him. In this movie, those are two of the three things worth watching. The third thing worth watching is Halle Berry and her canine bodyguards. We know what we are going to get from John in this movie but for about 10 minutes, Halle's bodyguards steal the movie. Halle did a really great job, surprisingly, looking natural with the fight choreography and gun play in the movie. Other than that, there are some good one liners that fans will understand from the first two movies. This movie has a strong beginning and I want to shout out my NBA fans. All I'll say is, \"Boban!\"NOW for the main course... the bad parts. THIS MOVIE HAS VERY LITTLE PLOT, DIALOGUE AND PLOT DEVELOPMENT. That makes the 2-hr movie quite rough to get through, even when you don't expect much in the plot realm anyway. This movie is two hours of almost non-stop fighting, shooting and gruesome killing. That's better than watching Keanu struggle to run for 2 hours, in hindsight (i.e. Tom Cruise in any Mission Impossible movie). This movie is easily 30 minutes too long. Most of that 30 minutes is solid fight scenes; however, they use the same grappling and jiu-jitsu moves in every single sequence throughout the movie for Keanu, Halle and in the previous movies. Therefore, the fighting gets old, especially in this movie, which had a very strong first 45 minutes.After that, they gave us a couple of laughs in this movie but they made the main villain and his lackeys too big of a joke. At first, the joke was funny but it wore out its welcome and they just kept hammering it home (similar to a Euron situation for my GoT fans). On top of that, the villains weren't even really trying to kill John towards the end, anyway. The director was like, \"hey everyone just slap fight with John. We'll keep the tape rolling until we run out\". It became hard to watch towards the end and I just wanted the movie to end. Not to mention, the other villain in the movie no one even tried to kill and you want her to die the most!Long story short, if you are a John Wick series fan, you have to see this but I'd suggest getting the cheapest price possible. Maybe save your money for John Wick 4, which is certain to happen and in hopes of a better movie. For the general fan, watch the the first John Wick and then decide if you want to keep watching in a matinee or rent/stream capacity only in the months to come.",

        "text": "John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum takes place immediately after the previous film, and the film's titunal character is now left to fend for himself on his own. After the events of the previous film, John Wick is now deemed \"excommunicado\", and is now unable to be protected by the organization he was once part of. With a large bounty on his head, he must traverse the streets of New York in hopes of finding a way out of his bounty.When it comes to the John Wick films, I don't really go into them expecting anything outside a lot of well-choreographed action. Fortunately, for this movie, we see a lot of action, which continues the trend throughout this franchise. Like the previous films, it utilizes a lot of amazingly choreographed fights, and what's amazing is how consistent they are throughout the film. This movie may be the most action-packed in the entire series, and they tend to get especially creative and over-the-top with said action, to the point where it feels like a Tarantino film. There are two major examples that come to mind when I think about the creativity on the action. First of all, Wick meets a dog trainer played by Halle Berry, and we have some awesome combat scenes that include those dogs. Another example would have to be when there is a chasing scene involving horses, and they do a lot with that.Outside of the action, I appreciate how the movie handles the world-building, and how it answers some more questions as to how the world works. I also like how it helps to build John Wick's character. We continue to see how his character is built through his actions. We also get some more insight into his past, particularly during the beginning of the second half. I also love the set design throughout the film, as it can get especially creative, and enhance the movie's action on display. This can be displayed immensely throughout the third act of the movie.The title of my review says \"Pure popcorn fun\", and that's exactly what it is; alongside the other Wick films, it's style over substance. When this aspect does act as a strength, it's also what I see to be a weakness. Throughout the film, I was engaged and immersed in the action, but I found the narrative aspects to be a little weak. Many of the scenes that involve the story elements, to me felt tedious, and while it helps out with the world-building, I never really found myself engaged in said scenes, and I felt like they dragged the movie on at times.Despite my story complaints, I really enjoyed my time watching John Wick in his third round, and I think any action junkies would really appreciate it for what it has to offer as well.8/10",

Few of them are really long and feel like going on and on and on but damn who is complaining. Bring it on. The climax hand to hand kung fu fights are freakin brilliant. I thought this one was the last in the triology but they set up the premise for another sequel in the climax and i can't wait to see the next chapter. If you like action films don't dare to miss this one. This is going to be a considered a classic action film.",

And a horse - don't forget the horse!Overall, a welcome addition to the saga, if a little slower than Chapter 2, but it does add a tiny bit more back story to Mr Wick. Just remember: 'Guns... Lots of guns!'",

I was ready to grace it with my rare 10 star score but like all things in life, what goes up must come down, LOL. This is not to say JW3 was not great; it's just the action scenes became mundane although exciting.I still look very much forward to JW4 one day and hope they keep actors and behind the camera crew together because JW has the Matrix magic if they do.",

        "text": "About 6 months ago I saw a picture of the set of 'John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum' featuring Keanu Reeves on horseback shooting at motorcyclists. It was such a great looking shot that I have been waiting eagerly to see how it looked in the actual film ever since. It did not let me down. The style this film possesses is insane. It is one of the best looking action films I have ever seen.The pacing of this film is also incredible. It starts the action immediately and almost never lets up. I can't wait to see what the death count was in this film because it will be truly enormous. The only problem is when the death count is that high the film can struggle to keep the originality up. After a while each death starts to look very similar to the last, and the 50 before that, and it can even become a little tedious to watch.The only other flaw I came across with the film was that John Wick is on the defence too much. Instead of being angry and on the hunt like the first two films, for the majority of the Chapter 3 he is in survival mode. Still very fun to watch, but it isn't quite the same as seeing him take brutal revenge.And the film is brutal. I could be wrong but I don't remember the first two entries in the series making me cringe in terms of violence as much. There were some very hard things to watch at times in this movie even for me, and I pride myself on handling those sorts of things fine most of the time. One of them early on got an audible gasp from the entire audience and I saw multiple people having to turn their heads to the side.'John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum' is two hours of your life that will pass by very quickly. This is as non-stop action as films get. I think this is the third best action series currently producing movies (after 'James Bond' and 'Mission Impossible'). Will it get a third one? The first entry on the trivia page suggests no, however the end of this movie suggests yes? I guess we will have to wait to find out. For now enjoy the hell out of this one.",

        "text": "This movie is non stop high octane action at its absolute finest. Dull? How could anyone say this movie is dull? The close combat action is simply the greatest in cinema history it is absolute mastery. Dull is the last word that I'd use to describe this movie. I'd like to know what action these negative reviewers actually like if they think the action in this movie is dull/boring. Non stop heart pumping action filmed impeccably. The story is light as the first two are, however since the first movie john wick 2 and now 3 have built upon the lightly established underworld and continue to delve deeper into the lore of this universe. The way that the films have progressed naturally and remained light on story while also expanding the lore is plain fantastic. Unrealistic? Yes, but that's like saying Star Wars is unrealistic because it has Light Sabers, of course there is no way that an underworld like this could exist in the real world, but it's not meant to be a representation of the real world! It's a movie, it's fantasy, if John Wick has to strictly be grounded in reality imagine how boring it'd be. Saying that it's unrealistic is purely ignorant as at this point Chad Stahelski has made it pretty clear it's not trying to be. Watch this movie at any opportunity you get, and the first two if you get the chance, all 3 are absolute masterclasses in action film making and belong all the way up there with the greatest action movies of all time like Terminator 2, The Dark Knight, The Matrix etc.\nAbsolutely a masterpiece!",

Also they stand out more than Tiger Hu Chen whose become very good friend of Keanu Reeves.\nI am a bit surprise that Reeves could say \"sampai jumpa\" quite fluent.\nCan wait the sequel of this movie and I hope more Indonesian actors cast for this movie. There are still Iko Uwais, Joe Taslim, and other indonesian actors fit for cast in this movie.",

To compensate for weak writing they cast an established star but it doesn't work. I don't believe her character.

The audience and I couldn't help but react to each gem of AWESOMENESS it provided.2) YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE WHAT'S GOING ON\nNone of that confusing flurry of hits and edits B.S. All fights and reactions are at human speed, so you can process, and \"buy\" what's happening.

I was scared that the third installment of the John Wick series might not be up to the mark as the first 2 had set the bars high. I have to say that the third one exceeds all my expectations and surpasses 1 and 2 by leaps.The fight scenes are not limited to Guns this time around, there are a lot of fights with knives, swords and sometimes random things like books, belts and horses. Keanu Reeves has delivered an amazing performance and it helps that he does not age.Lovely choice of actors to pay the various roles. I would have loved to see Ruby Rose again, but the new characters do not disappoint. Some of the strong characters in the movie have hardly any screen time. Most of the newly introduced characters leave us with more questions than answers. This makes more sense towards the end as you realize that you do not want this series to end at all, or better still - it would have been fantastic if John Wick were a series and we would not have to wait years between installments. Lovely character building and makes you want to see more of these characters.Halle Berry has a nice role with a lot of emotional background which are left vague - I wonder if she will get her own movie soon. If she does, I would be amongst the first to get the tickets- after all anyone with 2 awesome dogs deserves their own movie.As crazy as the fight sequences are, I love the way certain scenes make us smile. When John Wick started pulling signature WWE moves, I all but jumped out of my seat cheering.If there were one movie that was made with me in mind as the audience, it has to be John Wick - A hero with emotional baggage, almost suicidal with self-pity, A dog lover to the core, fight sequences that belong on stage as art, a different world within our world and the right kind of humor. I am glad that my biggest countdown of 2019 is a completely worth my time.",

The concept was great which means they could've made it a lot better if they would've focus more on suspense rather than just body count. They almost made a super hero movie like \"The superman who can't fly\". I would've been more impressed if the story was something like John Wick hides from the killers in most of the movie and finally he had to face them when they left him no place to hide. Then there would've been some action and blood shed but much less body count. This movie would've made sense at least if it was that way.",

        "text": "Here's my review of John wick : Parabellum . So what is the best action movie franchise right now ? Definitely Mission Impossible , due to the franchise' breathtaking action scenes and it's lead actor. The John Wick franchise is also the same only difference being it doesn't involve shaky cam . What I've loved about these movies since the first one is that it's an action movie with back to back action scenes with a very linear story in the middle . So you watch these just to see Keanu Reeves blow people's brains out . not 'A Dogs purpose' which ironically is also in theatres right now. This movie takes place right where John wick 2 left off , there's a manhunt with a price tag on him. Nothing I say is a spoiler cause the plot only exists to build an action scene. This movie explores more into the world of assassins than the other two and even digs a little bit into John wicks past . One of the unique things about this world is that it has a neon video game-ish tone to it. Not just the world , even the characters are very stoic ,they speak one liners , always monologuing and never show a human side even at dying moments . Now the action in this movie is just insanely good ! Most of them are not wide angle which means most of the stunts were performed by actors themselves and you can just see the effort. Some of the hand to hand combat is without cuts and it's really satisfying to see them. However there was this one scene with a very awkward edit and I thought how did they miss that . But that's when I noticed a few more of those and realised it was the Indian censor board who were responsible . I still don't understand why these people rate a movie as R and edit things in it. There was also a scene in a railway station where Wick kills a guy , it wasn't a stealth kill btw. But none of the public scream or anything they're just casual. Which can mean that everyone in there was an assassin including the kids or we're just supposed to accept it's a video game world. In the end , John wick talks less than Ryan gosling in Drive and ironically is in a movie which is pretty much what people thought Drive was going to be. So with great action , video game like characters , solid choreography , one huggable pupper , John wick is what I'd call arthouse action . Oh and there's guns. Lots and lots of guns !",

Not enough dialog. I could have waited for it to come on Netflix. I was certainly disappointed.",

It's a bit like Commando or Cobra from the 80's where there are a ton of bad guys all getting demolished. The action is way over the top but actually quite good. It also gives it a charm which you don't get these days.The story os solid but goes on far too long for me.The fight scenes are generally good and the pace of the film is solid but it goes a little too far at the end.Fun action film.",

For me, this movie and the previous Jonh Wick Titles , are now a Full Proof Reference of this kind of movies. Any Action Movie to be considered and rated good or not so good ,should be cross referenced to Jonh Wick´s.As for the title Parabellum , once again , action choreograpfy taken to perfection in timing , intensity, angles, a very well directed title.\nCast, just cannot see anyone else assuming any part, all them fit like a glove.\nKeanu is flawless, and all training and experience on other movies of this gender ,has paid up . Intense . Even on small comic reliefes during\nSountrack and effects are sublime . An immersive adrenaline bath of action that takes you on a high paced run for life itself.\nSaw it on IMAX, i tottaly recomend to see this movie",

        "text": "I enjoyed the first two productions of John Wick, really looking forward to the third one. Overall it was enjoyable but felt a little flat towards the end. Keanu Reeves was great as usual. I am not so sure about Halley Barry's performance, felt too forced at some point, though, she fought just as well. I wished the story would have revealed more about the world of the characters introduced rather than just en passing, have less but sharp action sequences but more of the story development on the different factions. The best fight sequences are in the beginning, after that it seems a little repetitive. Some parts of the actions felt confusing. One example is when John Wick faces two opponents in the Casablanca alleyway, while holding onto one knife attacker to fight the other, the first opponent remains inactive far too long to be unrealistic. It feels like the director compromised with that shot. Another scene in the end fight where two attackers with turtle neck sweater and jacket, both intentionally look similar going up against Wick. Wick kills one of them, but the other never reappears. I will have to watch it again to make sense. I will hold out on the third one giving it the benefit of the doubt as it leads to the fourth installment. I hope there's a better payoff. My 2 cents take on this one.",

It is so vast and detailed, I'm excited of the future possibilities. Halle Berry is an awesome addition to the story. She has a fight scene that is unique to this movie. I was blown away to find out there are many different sects that work in unison with the \"High Table.\" It truly does seem as if everything is intertwined within this under world. Illuminati if you will. This network is one of the best aspects of the entire story. Keanu returns with his usual stoic acting style to this blood and guts tale. It is one of the best trilogies I have ever seen. I can honestly say there is no drop off amongst any of the movies. Part 3 has a huge twist that I did not see coming. There is an infusion of humor that is unlike the other two movies, and it works well. See it!!!",

When the money men come to cash out, directorial insecurities spread Splash Bash and Flash, where we wanted believability (suspension of disbelief). Instead of building on the soul of the story, Wick as a man of focus and unequal determination - omeone we can believe in, the third and most charmless Wick falls on his sword, guts his integrity, quenches the flame of his name sake, and proves the parable: those that live in glass houses shouldn't throw us dissatisfying, open ended endings, that deceive us viewing lambs, to you think we will reach the greener pasture of satisfaction. Nay. The hay of a triumph was not for us to feed on. But to soak up our blood from the slaughterhouse floor: we were always going to be sacrificed for the shareholders bottom line. No Chad Stahelski, people who live in glass houses should not throw stones. Never mind of swords.",

And how glad i am to been proven wrong !John Wick (2014) came silently as an odd one out with action sequences based on solid foundation of ground work and actual tactical training , not to mention without shaky cams but i am certain the makers would have had their apprehensions. The difference in John Wick and other action movies might have missed the appreciation of general audience. But lucky for us it didn;t . And then from there Chad Stahelski was all set to deliver us back to back action masterpieces . But while the direction holds this series together , it is the amazing Keanu Reeves who has held it up high with his inspiring discipline and dedication.Coming to John Wick : Chapter 3 , the story remains simple . The high table is after John Wick's blood and since this is John Wick , there is no chance of amicable resolution. Numerous hand to hand combat scenes, chase sequences, uncountable corpses and lots and lots of gun form the canvas on which John Wick : Chapter 3 Parabellum begins to emerge. But while all this was exiting in the previous two installations too, where Chapter 3 differs is its treatment of villains . Setting up proper challenge for a character like John Wick is a job too tough to be reckoned with and this was perhaps the only thing which i think fell short of expectations in chapter 2. With chapter 3 the movie takes a better approach and rather than putting a face , we have a concept , a fearsome concept of High table against John Wick. The Omnipotent high table and a lone warrior against it - how mythical and majestic that sounds .\"Art is pain\" - as a line goes in the movie and Keanu Reeves it appears has suffered more than we would fathom , training and preparing for his role . But it has payed off well it seems . John Wick is and always will be a legend . I am not sure if there is another installation in the making but if the makers have even a slightest doubt that it will fail to match John Wick's status, they better leave it alone. What we have here is perfection portrayed and if you haven't watched John Wick yet , you are missing on one of the shiniest gem of action movies.",

The choreography of the fight scenes were innovative and very well done. Often a fight scene will last for what felt like 2 minutes without a camera break - that takes so much practice.Possibly the best of the series in terms of action but the weakest in terms of storyline. Not too much depth in terms of plot, but the story was pretty obvious and executed well. The best part of this film was the chemistry between several characters and Wick.The film is anything but flawless, but bottom line - if you l8ked the first 2 Wick films, you will like this one.",

Non-stop shooting and melee without enough creativity where the protagonist wears plot armor simply gets tiresome.A side note, I had a somewhat similar detached feeling for a somewhat shorter duration while watching Inception (a vastly better movie with a strong plot) when antagonists \"in a dream in a dream in a dream\" were attacking with firearms for the N'th time where I had stopped counting N.The derivation of the said verdict is not obvious given that I liked John Wick I and II. Sure, the plots have mostly been nonsense but the creative carnage made John Wick worth watching. Style over substance, in a good way. Even so, the plots of I and II were more engaging to me, subjective as it is.Don't get me wrong, Parabellum isn't horrible, but it's a disappointment. The next entry of the franchise needs to be better.",

The fight scenes are good but most of them just go on WAY too long, it feels forced and for the sake of and they just keep doing the same stunts over and over, it was just boring repetitive action. The movie sort of redeemed itself towards the end but the damage had already been done, this movie has no substance to get the viewer gripped, its just like oh another repetitive long shoot out, yawn.

John Wick 1 did it well, open our eyes with a making-sense fighting scenes of skillful hitmen.The drama of the murdered of the beloved dog, as big reason for Wick to somehow get back in business, quite get us. But in John Wick 2 there was simple story made up for this sequel. Once again Wick is involved in fight, bang-bang! scenes. We know hundreds of scripts are available to develop the story, this one is lame. I believe it is more about the deadline and bottom line who decide drama part should step aside. Still it was a box office anyway.Now John Wick 3, the fight, bang-bang! scenes have reached new level, dominates over 90% of the scenes. They creatively choreographed the rumbles. Gore rumbles. They also dare to use mostly steady camera shooting. Frankly resulting of unreal moves, slow punching and kicking. We clearly see many times in certain step of fight, the bounty hunters wait and give open spot for Wick to hit. This is not good. I know in Bourne trilogy, the fight scenes were totally helped by moving camera shooting, quite stressing our visions, but well-done made us believe how cool is Matt Damon, or how tough is Liam Neeson in Taken. Keanu Reeves is not young anymore, my hat off though, but they should come up with better idea to cover his age.Last but not least, I am Indonesian and so proud of putting two fellas Indonesian martial artists in the final scenes, Cecep and Yayan. They did true awesome job.It is also good to see Mark \"paranaue\" Dacascos spin his kicks once again.",

John Wick, imo, is the best thing to happen to his career entirely! NOBODY can replace Reeves as Wick, because Keanu Reeves is John Wick and John Wick is Keanu Reeves!John Wick 3 for the third time in a row has nailed its unique gritty yet flashy fighting style, gun fu, beautiful camera work, amazing stunt work, beautiful cinematography, overall amazing visual and coloring, and IMMERSIVE fight sequences, and believe me, there are A BUNCH of them..... Usually in fight scenes, a fight is at least 2 minutes long, but almost every fight scene is several minutes long, and that is not something easy to pull off without being boring! There is not once frame of boredom in this movie, especially in the fight scenes, whether it be hand-to-hand or gun fighting. John Wick does a lot of different things in this movie that he has not done in the past movie, and one thing I really like about this movie is that it shows that he is still a human being, he is no super human, he is just a flesh and blood human mortal under that suit filled with bullet resistant armor. He does get wrecked quite a bit in this movie, allowing the audience to get that feeling that he really is in danger and can be beaten down.During this movie, there is a lot of subtle comedy spread throughout, specially in fight scenes, and I really felt that was a nice touch and fit, to add more uniqueness to this movie. Mark Dacascos also does GREAT in this. He is also unexpectedly goofy in this movie as well, but is did work VERY well!Halle Berry makes an appearance in this movie, that is rather a small part, still makes her time on screen TOTALLY worth it.... She shows that she went through similar training that Keanu did for these movies and she really kills it, along with her two dogs!While this movie continues to amaze with Keanu's performace and complete commitment to John Wick, the story is, while not bad, it is not entirely in your face, like parts 1 and 2 were. Yes, the premise is there and is well executed, John has to survive his excommunicado after spilling blood in the Continental hotel in part 2, there is more to the story that I feel should have had more oomph to it, more energy. The story is there, just doesn't feel as strong as parts 1 and 2. And the conclusion to this movie is, while not bad or awful, is nowhere near as good or badass as the conclusion in part 2, with John running away with his dog. There are also some scenes, while not boring, at the same time, feel a bit fuller. They are clearly part of the story, but while these scenes are happening, they feel dialed down, and how the scenes are executed, not the right feel for this movie. Thankfully, Reeves' performance makes up for it!This is more of a nitpick, but Common is not in this. He is nowhere at all in this movie and that is kind of a bummer. He felt like an important character in part 2, and was nonexistent in part 3. Also, John Leguizamo isn't in this either. Neither is Jimmy. Would have been nice if these guys had involvement in this movie somehow.Overall: 8.5/10. While not as strong as the first two, story-wise, John Wick 3 continues to impress with very much so everything else! The audience will be very immersed with this one! Hopefully part 2 will be an immersion as well!",

Everytime John Wick is shot, stabbed, bounced off of the hood and/or the windshield of a vehicle he seems to take some degree of injury. But, where as most anyone, specifically in the real world, would be dead relatively quickly, John Wick is obviously immortal. This idiot does not know when to throw in the towel and just give it up and he can not die. In this installment, for example, he is thrown off of the roof of a building 🏢, that is at least 10 stories high, bounced off of the roof on the edge of the building here, bounces off of an awning there, etc., landing in the alley below relatively weak & in apparent pain - with evidently no broken bones - still very much alive!All of these films, not just \"Parabellum\", are a live-action cartoon filled with gratuitous gore-porn.They're really not worth it!",

The issue is that there is a lot of action, too much action, and some fighting scenes were overdrawn such that it becomes boring, especially during the fighting scenes with the Japanese guys.The plot is kinda thin as well, luckily the execution is still amazing, save for the last part of the movie. Dogs are still the highlight of this series (lol).In conclusion, still the same old John Wick, but with less comedy and less the \"John Wick is a man of will.... \" lengendary quote and more of senseless fighting. But all in all, still very entertaining most of the time.",

Assassins from all walks of life are trying their luck on the fortune.\nThe action is still over-the-top like with the two previous movies. Sound editing and cinematography are top-notch. New characters are introduced, though we need more room for them to be developed. Some gunfights are happening in broad daylight and too many hitmen are going after him. If the assassin world is supposed to be secret, why are the trained killers exposing themselves to the public? The final scene has made him a superhero, which somehow reminds us that no advanced technology or supernatural element is involved here. But still, the movie is cinematic adrenaline, so I give 9/10 stars.",

        "text": "John Wick 3 continues the series tradition with excellent action scenes. No sloppy cuts or poor CGI to be found here. In the first few minutes, the movie surpasses its previous action scenes. In fact, I'd say the first thirty minutes of this film are pure bliss for those that love excellent fight choreography. Keanu Reeves continues to perform amazing fight scenes and make his character compelling and endearing. Even better, John Wick 3 adds moments to give John Wick some depth again, nice little emotional moments which bring the film up in writing quality. The writing is also quite interesting with a few interesting twists, refreshing variety in locations, and a plethora of interesting new allies and villains for John to interact with. I will say I felt the middle section of the film was largely a waste, but I enjoyed so much of the journey, I didn't much mind. I also wish there had been another club scene with Le Castlevania playing but alas, there is not. In the end, John Wick 3 is a wonderful action movie from beginning to end. It's camera work and visuals continue to impress. And Keanu Reeves continues to be a pleasure to watch with his amazing athleticism and knack for bringing action to life.",

        "text": "I loved the first two John Wick films and was really excited to see this one...but jesus christ, did they ruin it with Halle Berry.As with every new films these days, there has to be an enforced feminist angle which you have no choice but to get used to, but they wen't too far by basically adding the female version of John, only without any back story and Halle Berry was noooooowhere near the level of Keanu with choreography,One particular long scene half-way through the movie just ruined it for me. They literally had the extra doing nothing for 5 seconds while she tried to reload her gun. Add that to the other slow motion fight sequences and lacklustre choreography. It was almost as bad as when they had to edit out the weapon that was clearly going to hit Rey in The Last Jedi.The other reason I've given it 5 stars is because there comes a certain point where you have to either establish that it's a science fiction/fantasy film or dial down the unrealistic action. In particular:\nNo human being, not even John, can get up and fight after being slammed by a carYou can't just keep having extras walking up to within 5 yards of John when they could just stay where they are and shoot himHaving your head slammed against walls and glass windows multiple times is going to knock you unconscious and make you bleedThe first two films certainly pushed the boundaries but there was at least a small element of realism.I think this film is guilty of trying to outdo itself, but it only ends up undoing itself.The locations, cinematography, and overall style to the film is top-notch though. It's a fun film and worth a watch despite its downfalls.",

An impressive fact since he also used axes, knives, swords and a horse ! This may make this sound somewhat dull and repetitive, but full credit to the fight choreography, it's some of the vrst, showing real flaire and imagination. Where the films loses out is that the story does little with remarkable unseen world of assassins created in previous films. Although clearly a violent action packed thriller, there was also some story creativity here, as well as a baffling aray of quirky supporting characters. Not so much here and over reliance on the action set pieces does diminish the overall impact of the film.",

There's amazingly well choreographed, wide and single camera shots, that really show you the real and gritty nature of fights. It's also very creative, and constantly changing the environment and weapons, to keep you entertained. However ,this isn't really what holds you in.You have action scenes sandwiched between really slow character moments. And the action being so good, makes the storylines between them, really pointless. You're just waiting for the next big moment, and there's a strong possibility that you'd be oversaturated with the fights after about an hour.\nI feel like this movie could have been 30 minutes shorter, and still covered a majority of it's story.If you're in for John Wick, you'll enjoy this collection of dogs and humans teaming up in a PUBG styled film. Otherwise, it's your average ,but well done action flick.",

        "text": "This (so far) is my second favorite of the series. It really needed a cool car (I'm a huge GTO fan - we have 3). Since it the series had representation from Ford and GM I think an AMX or Cuda would have brought the score up to an 8. I know, mindless violence, but isn't going to the movies supposed to be an escape...The cast did a fabulous job. Especially my favorites Ian McShane and Lawrence Fishburne. Of note the only cast member I did not enjoy was Kate Dillon. It seems her entire shtick is to be annoying. I felt that was about everything I've seen her in. It didn't really work out for Andy Kaufman!And most of all I love seeing big smooches from Pit Bulls (even though we we're wiener dog fans). Enjoy it!",

Second did venture a bit into a little overkill with story, but still sustained its original simplicity.

        "text": "Where Chapters 1 and 2 both felt like they were building towards something and did a great job of both slowly building the world John Wick inhabits, as slowly tearing down the man that is (or was) John Wick, Chapter 3 seems to ignore what was going on and just becomes generic good-looking action fodder.Because Parabellum does look good and Reeves keeps going through the motions well enough, but with a plot that's all over the place and more full of holes than his victims, there's only so much Reeves and some of the extras can do.In chapters 1 and 2 we were led to believe that Wick's sheer force of will and drive were what made him special. A Cassian came close in chapter 2, but ultimately didn't stand a chance, in spite of a history with Wick. But now we find ourselves in a world where many people appear to match his skill and New York alone appears overrun with assassins that are a match for Wick.With the hero no longer being special, everybody and their dog in on the game, allegiances in the wind and Wick surviving as much through luck and whim as anything else, there are no stakes and Parabellum falls flat. Deeply unsatisfying.",

        "text": "The action was top class, as expected, but they went too far with it this time because this isn't a film, it's just a string of action sequences. The characters and story are irrelevant and there is no tension, because we know Wick is going to carve his way through every scene full of extras.The first two films managed to blend action with artistic cinematography, sets, costumes and music while retaining tension and drama by teasing us with glimpses of a criminal underworld, which worked because it remained largely a mystery. The casting was also spot on. An honour bound collective of hitmen living as members of a secret society teetering on the brink of anarchy was a much more interesting premise than the rigid subservient hierarchy to the \"High Table\" revealed in Parabellum.The plot relies too much on characters from earlier films, while the new cast are all bland cardboard cut-outs, especially the forgettable \"Adjudicator\" who lacks menace and Mark Dacascos, who is miscast as the main villain. I also don't understand why Halle Berry still gets roles like this when she's just playing herself. Unfortunately, she's not interesting enough to get away with it! Alfie Allen (from the first film) was a better villain than ALL of the bad guys in this film, yet all he did was kill a dog! Similarly, the Continental's concierge was ok playing a minor role as a dog minder but he's boringly unconvincing as a fellow assassin.The film lacks any sense of threat and consequently suffers from a lack of drama. Without these story hooks the repetitive action sequences become meaningless after a while. I can't believe I lost interest in the characters and no longer cared what would happen. Yes, that's right, I got bored watching a John Wick movie!This is a huge misstep as it's significantly worse than the previous two films. The impressive action is still praiseworthy but fight scenes alone don't make a movie, so they aren't enough to save it from being a disappointment.MEDIOCRE 5/10",

Parabellum lives up to its name I knew I would enjoy this but man the very opening scenes to finished I was gripped in, very well acted clean fighting. The visuals were spectacular and this world was very well done. I loved every second of this movie. I enjoyed this alot more than any of the Avengers and probably any action movie I have ever seen.

Personally, I found 1 the best, then 2 followed by 3.I'd say here is more action, especially martial arts-wise, and less story than before.The fight scenes with Dacascos and also his 2 main disciples - who played the 2 martial arts villains in the Raid 1 & 2 - were a real nice touch. Tho these guys had better fight scenes before. But then again this is a Hollywood action movie and not mainly a beat 'em up-flick.If you liked 1 and 2, then there is no reason not to watch 3.",

However, the plot seems to be beginning to suffer as the action sequences improve. I get it, we're not really here to watch this for the plot or the writing, but they seem to be getting lazy. Baddies have multiple opportunities to kill John and pass it up because they want to keep fighting? The final sequence feels more like a video game as John ascends a new flight of stairs3 times and faces a more difficult \"boss\" on each level. Overall, still a fantastic film but there's a little room for improvement.",

        "text": "I watched this film before reading reviews and was left baffled and frustrated with the bad reviews for John Wick 3. People have complained about poor story and boring action scenes; I don't watch action films for the story, I don't expect to be emotionally moved or learn something profound by the end credits. I do however watch for incredible cinematography, soundtrack, and action- which this film absolutely delivers. So I wholeheartedly disagree with any review below 6 stars.Some moments in the film certainly push how far you can suspend your disbelief, you will probably sit there thinking \"there's no way he can get out of this\" and you'll definitely see stunt actors patiently waiting their turn to hit Keanu Reeves. But even then, it's not as unrealistic as some films where the stunt men stand there for multiple beats before leaping to their punch. Because at the end of the day, you'll be very hard pushed to find an exciting action film in which there aren't people waiting their turn to be killed.At the beginning of the film there is a truly epic fight sequence that is masterful in my opinion, and I would recommend this film purely for that scene. Hand to hand combat can be silly or fantastic and this John Wick fight scene early on in the film immediately earned top spot among my favourite action sequences. The choreographers, actors and stunt people involved should be highly commended- I was on the edge of my seat and contorted in all kinds of positions throughout the film.\nWhile other action sequences and scenes had me contorted and on the edge of my seat, that first one (I think you'll know the one I mean when you watch the film) remained the best.So no- I can't give this 10 stars, even though it's now my favourite non-Jason Bourne action film, because it does lack some story elements and did have me disconnected in one ridiculously improbable stand off scene. But 9 stars means I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this film and ask that you ignore all the bad reviews becuase this is a very well made film and deserves high praise.It's an action film at the end of the day- the people giving bad reviews were watching the wrong film honestly.\nLike asking an apple to be a tomato, they're both round but an apple sauce doesn't go with pasta the same way tomato sauce does, they were asking the wrong things of this action film.(Side note- nowhere is this film categorised as a comedy but I would say it is)",

Bad guys spend seconds in frame just standing watching John Wick do a dozen choreographed fight moves. It's somewhat mindless entertainment for the first 15 minutes, but becomes downright boring by the second half of the film. Where is the efficient ruthlessness???The film is very overtly self-referential, which just further reminds you of the superiority of the earlier films. We get it, John likes dogs and did this all for a puppy in Wick 1. We get it, John Wick is feared and respected in this criminal underworld. Show me more, tell me less.Finally, the film seems the lead up to a final showdown with the main villain, Zero, played by Mark Dacascos. Without getting into specifics, Zero is sort of \"meh.\" I can't muster up the energy to really write more or care about him.This review will not tackle any plot holes or the overall plot itself, which is also not without major faults.Oh, and Halle Berry is not good.",

And for those action fans who can appreciate them done/handled with an extreme attention to detail. Think \"Enter the Dragon\" meets \"The Professional\" (aka \"León\")If you enjoy realistic action, the fighting scenes are amazing, unrelenting, and a non-stop adrenaline rush.Fighting aside, the photography, scenery, landescape visuals and music are lavishly captured & selected giving the action a break.The supporting characters, who although appearing briefly in their roles, are adequately portrayed and cast perfectly to keep the story going.This being a sequel, most likely to be followed by another, it delivered what I thought was expected of it in this \"chapter.\"",

My wife screaming \"Thank god we didn't bring our kid\" in the first five minutes would probably give you an imagination of what to expect.My only complaint is probably the loose ending, but I hope time gives me a better perspective.Also it ends with a cheer for an even more exciting and broad universe of chapter 4.",

Wick is as unkillable as a video game character. There is no wit and everyone just takes themselves WAY too seriously. The film is just a vessel for endless fighting scenes, some of which are oddly choreographed - actors just stopping, waiting for a next move - others are entertaining. In sum, it gets boring though. Production values are high, of course, but, overall, this is crap.",

Combat flows very organically, both shooting and martial art sections, and all without the continuous cuts and terrible shaky cam that we see in basically every other action movie. Keanu Reeves also plays nearly all action scenes by himself (no stuntman), which is one of the reason the director can have long action scenes without cuts or interruptions! So, Action: 10/10On the other hand, the plot is... meh. John Wick is trying to escape from basically every other assassin in the whole world and seeking the few allies that could somehow help him. Nothing too shocking, just a pretext to show amazing action.In conclusion, watch this movie if you like great action. And trust me, it's GREAT! But if you are searching for a deep and complex plot or profound emotions, you won't find them here.",

It has its tongue firmly in its cheek and a can get a bit silly, but it's great fun.The Fight choreography is very slick and inventive, as always. From the exceptional use of library books at the start to gorgeous and brutal dog bodyguards and a trek across the Moroccan desert, it's an adrenaline fuelled ride.Keanu Reeves gives his all as John Wick, he is so well suited to this action filled role, and it's clear he loves every minute of it. There are some great actors in smaller roles including; Jerome Flynn as Berrada with a dodgy accent and providing the vaguest directions ever, and Halle Berry as Sofia, master dog handler.Laurence Fishburne as Bowery King, Lance Reddick as Charon and Ian McShane as Winston are super cool and good value as ever. A Crying Freeman-esque Mark Dacascos is a welcome addition to the hit man crowd as Zero.",

Its been a long dam time but this was an awesome performance on her part.The real letdown here is for all the amazing use of practical effects and wonderful action and choreography, the minimal and limited CGI used, was outrightly terrible.Every gun shot had CGI blood splatter, and they looked terrible. If they had just used no blood splatters at all, that would have been even better. Some knife play scenes where the knife went into a person's body, looked super fake. The terrible CGI really took me out of the film.There is a major climatic scene where John falls off of a very high building, Its obviously CGI, and terribly so.For one of the few major scenes where a lot of CGI was used they could have made sure that one scene looked as good as possible.But they didn't.",

The world building went to even greater depth. Keanu Reaves is an absolute monster, and despite his more wooden acting style, it works perfectly for his now iconic John wick character. This isn't a drawback, but more of an observation, but although the movie is just over 2 hours long it feels a lot longer, not that I was complaining, it just felt so much action was packed in. Can't praise it enough, the reason I dont give it a 10 is because I didn't really like the adjudicator character, some bodies just disappear completely and the public/ civilians don't seem to react to people dying right next to them. Also the ending was a bit wtf? As in how? But other than that, it is absolutely brilliant and a must watch for any action fan.",

He does it with style, he kills with horses, dogs and even on a motorbike. He's the bionic man, you can shoot him, push him off a building, stab him and he'll still kick your ass.If you want to watch something without having to engage your braincells and gratuitous unbelievable violence is your dig, then this film will pass a couple hours.",

The reason I don't give it a 10/10 is because some moments seemed very staged & absurd that John Wick himself was able to kill some people the way he did & how the dogs never got shot once out of all those enemies shooting at them. Some moments even made me laugh due to its absurdity. However, this movie has a lot of brutal fun that will keep you on the edge of your seat & wanting more & has some of the most revolutionary action scenes. I give this an 8/10.",

The street scenes were captured very beautifully. The desert scenes were amazing.It was nice to see many tv actors like Asia Kate Dillon (Taylor Mason from Billions), Jerome Flynn (Bronn from Game of Thrones), Robin Lord Taylor (Penguin), Jason Mantzoukas (Adrian Pimento from Brooklyn Nine-Nine) and some others too.My Favorite moment where John Wick's enemies tell him during fight that they are honored to fight with him.Can't wait for the next chapter.",

The use of weapons, the angle of the shot, the way in which they have achieved every element of the film.You get a breather in the middle of film when John meets the top of the chain of bad guys then it's straight back into the action.

The story is extremely thin and it tends to go from fighting scene to fighting scene, hoping that the viewer will forget that it should be the story that makes or breaks a movie. And some people do forget. As for me, unfortunately, I was bored out of my head after a while, wondering if there was something I was missing. Or am I simply getting too old for action movies.I'd say this movie makes a good experiment. Action over story. Yay or Nay.Looking at the scores, unfortunately for me, it's a yay.I'll resort to drama next time, where they still value the story, as for me it's one huge failed experiment.",

        "text": "Let me get this out of the way; This movie is good. I wanted to say that because I've seen a lot of really positive reactions to this movie, and I didn't want my review to come across as a negative review. But, because I'm talking negatives, I guess I'll get into my biggest issue with this movie.When I look at an action movie, one that's passable will have decent action with a passable story. Looking at the end of the second one, the movie already had the set up for a very simple but effective story; John Wick must escape New York. However, Chapter 3 goes a little more into the world of John Wick, which in concept sounds cool, but not so much in execution. The second act of this movie is bogged down by an exploration of the world that feels the same to what we've already seen. The whole segment is never as good as the first and third act, which brings me back into the positives.Easily the best part of this movie is the first 20 minutes. The action is incredible and it's a nonstop thrill ride, something I wanted for the whole movie. Even when it gets into the second act, the action remains solid, and that transfers into the third act. Of course, that's really what you're going to this movie for. The preformences are all fine enough(concierge is still my favorite part), and while Keanu Reaves isn't known for his great acting, he still delivers a solid preference because of his dedication to the action sequences. Also, I think this goes without saying, but the cinematography is pretty good.I think this movie is definitely worth seeing, but I couldn't get behind it as much as others have. I give it a 7/10.",

I give all 3 films the exact same score. But that said - if John Wick 4 is as good as the first 3, I am IN.NOTE: I strongly suggest watching the first two films before enjoying this one.",

They are gratuitous, 'reality skewing' and fun......in a violent kind of way!If that sounds appealing, watch all three.I have now seen all three JW films and I enjoyed the first the most. I did think that this third film wouldn't improve on what they have already done, but it appears that if you leave enough of a time gap between them, they are all a very entertaining watch. If I watched them back to back, I personally would fatigue quite quickly.I feel that many reviewers here have highlighted some negatives that would look to shame other films, but in this case they are stating simply what the film is supposed to be. It's not a complex film, so it is not worth wanting it to be one. The narrative exists to drive the action to each scene/ set-piece. Simplicity. This said, you have to admire the high level of art and technical skill where it's due.I'm sure that there is a wealth of creative 'gun fu' style movies out there that doesn't make JW stand out too much, but to me (a novice to the genre) these films have a place.So there is potential in that another episode will be made and given enough of a gap, I'll be happy to watch it.",

No offense to the filmmaker but the writing was never the movies strong suit and it showed in the second film when they tried to introduce the world and characters. I was also worried about the pacing, the second film was pretty exhausting, while the combat choreography was very well done and Keanu Reeves sells his hard work very well but it simply was too much. Having a 2 hour long movie just about the fight might get exhausting pretty quickly but I am happy to say John Wick 3 managed to keep my attention throughout and it was a rather enjoyable ride.I am not sure how far they can take this franchise but I would really like to see Keanu Get back into acting. I always liked Reeves's older movies, he is not the most versatile actor but he was decent in the roles he played. There is definitely a deterioration in his acting skills as he comes off more as a stuntmant that has just started into an acting career. Here is hoping he regains some of his talents and gets to start in some different films.",

        "text": "The John Wick series is the very best place to go if you want intense, incredibly well-choreographed action.The film opens immediately after Chapter 2, with John Wick an hour away from being excommunicated from the assassin community and being marked for death. While the story structure is just fine, the action is what takes center stage. The film feels like it has more action sequences than the first two titles put together. John Wick 3 works miracles though, and these scenes never get tiring or overstay their welcome. They are also shot in such a way that glorifies the fight choreography and follows the fights in a coherent manner. Most action films focus on multiple edits per second in order to manufacture intensity from a dull fight, but the fights and shootouts in JW3 stand on their own.The acting is excellent all around. Veteran characters like Winston, the Concierge and the Bowery King all get their time in the spotlight. New characters like the Adjudicator and Zero are excellent.Sadly, there are a couple of negatives. Once in a while there are lapses in logic. On more than one occasion I found myself mentally urging characters to just shoot someone already, because letting them live will just cause bigger problems later on. And sure enough, those problems come flooding in.Near the end, a character with whom we are quite familiar makes a baffling and idiotic decision that completely goes against his character.I also wasn't thrilled with the fact that the film spent time setting up another sequel. This series hasn't dipped in quality yet, but if they keep going on without end, then they're sure to slip up at some point.All in all, a damn fine cinematic experience. The major theme at work is that actions have consequences. If you decide to see this film, the consequence is that you will be thrilled for almost every second of the runtime.9/10",

        "text": "John Wick: Chapter 3 Parabellum\nDirected by Chad StahelskiJohn Wick 3 is the thrilling continuation of this up and coming action series. The story is engaging enough to follow to bring us to each brilliantly choreographed fight scene and shootout. This has created one of the best action trilogies in modern times.The film starts with a very intense first act as John Wick is on the run from assassins everywhere. Things take off at a very fast pace as within minutes, John Wick already begins killing in some fun and creative action sequences. One kill early on in particular shocked the entire theatre helping to set the brutal tone for this fun thrill ride.From there the film goes global while greatly expanding on the world built within the first 2 installment. This leads to an incredibly well made set piece with some dogs getting in the action and racking up some kills. It's truly exciting stuff. Seen in a theatre, you feel the impact of every shot and every punch strongly which makes for a thrilling experience.We then arrive to the third act which begins with a exhilarating chase with incredible stuntwork along a highway in Manhattan. They keep the adrenaline up with an intense and very entertaining shootout sequence in the dark hotel lobby changing up the game with some fun suprises involved.The final fight is one of the best shot and choreographed fights I've seen in quite a while. Taking place in a mirror room makes for some incredible cinematography while also playing some tricks with your eyes. The brutal fight scene has very few cuts and is all in camera making for another very entertaining scene in the film.Overall this is another very well made film in this franchise. It is very fast paced with exhilarating and amazingly choreographed action. It is visually stunning while also packing a punch in the sound department. This makes for some of the best action we will see all year and is a must see for fans of the franchise and the genre.\n9/10",

        "text": "I had trouble getting involved with the previous incarnations. They were bookmarked on my HBOGO for months but it just never took. 10 minutes trying and I always switched over to youtube or something else.I went to see this because I snuck into the theater after seeing Godzilla. I had nothing to lose since I already put my $6 AMC Tuesday deal to function on the monster movie - which I thought kinda sucked.From the first scene to the last, I was surprised and entertained the whole way through. The killing and maiming is over the top and fresh - but not in the annoying. cloying Tarantino way. How many times can I watch a guy get knifed in the face? A lot, apparently. It doesn't really get old, as the director here shows us.Keanu is a great action star and most of the bad guys do it well. The worst part of the movie - and I think that 90 percent of the people will agree - was the part of the Adjudicator. I rarely think about casting but that actor was absolutely terrible. Even the bad guys have to have charisma. But this actor was so ineffective, annoying, drab, boring. Her monotone voice did not give the impression of casual indifference to death and destruction - it gave the impression that the casting director is an unbelievable idiot. Is she famous and that's why she got the part? Her scenes were the worst part about this movie, for sure. Do I need to go on? Also, Lawrence Fishburn was kind of unnecessary but I'm not going to complain about that as much. Not sure if it loses one star or two because of the dumb adjudicator.Great action movie. Definitely recommend.",

Poorly choreographed, slow, and too much superfluous flailing by the stuntmen to make the fight scenes seem \"busy\". John Wick 3 finally has some quality scenes, with the horse chase, halle berry duo scene, and the hotel gun shootout being the most memorable ones. Halle Berry really killed it with her role.",

John Wick 3 is as you would expect jam packed with action, great scenes and even builds upon the world that we already know in a very, very good way.The fight choreography is absolutely amazing and John is as usual utterly bad-ass, beautiful locations come into this chapter that we haven't seen in the previous two and there's a reasonably good level of over the top \"wow\" moments to the point of the audience literally laughing at how insane it is however......something was not quite right with this, I love that it is not what you expect and it hasn't fallen into the last Jedi or game of thrones trap or subversion yet there were, in my opinion, some severe issues with the third act of the film.While I can agree that there is a serious amount of poetic license and suspension of belief required to enjoy the John Wick franchise it kept it to a level of agreeableness in the first 2 films, it gets somewhat outlandish and rather ridiculous unfortunately in this chapter.Overall it's a good film, well worth seeing and the action is fantastic but the ending is to me very, very odd, the final fight sequence is not great (the first 30 minutes is by far the best part of the film) and some of the characters really don't quite hit the mark, especially, and unfortunately, Lawrence Fishburne as the Bowery King and Halle Berry as.... cant say due to spoilers.It's the weakest one of the three but it's still good, enjoy the action, and enjoy the (majority of) the characters, at the end though I fear you will be a bit lost to it all, certainly not a great ending to what is otherwise the best action movie trilogy for a long, long time.",

The fight scenes were to rehearsed and you can see gaps in the fighting where Keanu takes a step to wait for the moment he is supposed to grab the guy. If at the Continentalhotel Keanu would have been using a 308 cartridge in his rifle then their is no bullet proof vest or clothing that would stop that from killing! The movie just seemed different from the first 2 in that they were trying to incorporate so many things dogs, horses and going to so many places it's too much. Stick to what got you here. Get whomever back that made the fight scenes fluid and it's not how many men can he kill but the smooth storyline and fighting scenes that make the first 2 movies hits!",

You have to see this in a Dolby Atmos theater as the picture and sound were amazing. Most likely the best action movie, I'm sorry the BEST movie period. I saw Endgame and it was good, but this was so much more entertaining. Great ending as well.",

        "text": "As a lifelong fan of action movies, and one who would give the original John Wick a 9, I was very disappointed by the end of John Wick 3: Parabellum. No, scratch that - I was tired. My wife actually fell asleep on my lap. I was as exhausted as John Wick himself was supposed to be, having fought no less than four massive groups of assassins in seven days, killed them all, and come out of it all with only relatively minor injuries.I guess what it came down to was that everyone was trying hard, and they were actually trying TOO hard, imho. Powerhouse actors like Keanu and Laurence Fishburn and Angelica Huston put an awful lot into making their characters more than just two-dimensional, while Ian McShane didn't quite phone it in, he just wasn't given much to work with.This is the transitional movie, though. Where the first movie can easily stand alone on its own two feet, this is part two in a trilogy and has to give you all the exposition, all the fleshing-out of the world, all the history and backstory that everyone is apparently craving. But when every fight scene is seven or more minutes strung together and the bad guys with guns have worse aim than stormtroopers, it gets exhausting, and not in a good way.You could easily cut this down to 90 minutes and not lose an ounce of the story and let us prepare for the action that John Wick 4 will bring us. But when you have too many \"climactic\" fights in a story that we all know doesn't end here, it's too much.",

It is campy, cheesy, action packed, beautifully filmed, amazingly choreographed, and hilarious!! Literally the entire theater was laughing which is a rarity even for some comedies. These movies are in no way comedies, nor are they trying to be, but the humor is flawlessly timed and truly perfect.Anyway, this is, in my opinion, the best John wick film yet. It is great fun, and a crazy wild ride. Definitely not for kids!! But a great time for adults.",

There were numerous opportunities where the person appearing to want to kill John, stop mid kill to let him get up dust off his suit, load his gun and try again. It was like giving him a second chance and I don't get the punching and kicking when you could stab, slice, or kill in the time it takes you to dance around with a sword or knife. Fight scenes were entertaining but quickly became comical and dull as they lost their believability. Wait for it on Netflix. You will be glad you did.",

Most of them just do it to be live on his broadcast, all of them don't want to really hurt the streamer, they are all his biggest fans, they most likely could beat the streamer but it would make him look bad.Literally the entire movie, no real spoilers cause there is nothing to spoil. Basically they don't wanna kill him, they wanna die by his hand, they love him and idolize him. So just go to twitch and watch any big streamer play games. Shroud is one of the best examples, he has 20 kills, 10 of which at least are naked fans that just jump out and let Shroud kill them. Only in this case, it's 20 out of 20.Stay away from the movie if you want a serious and good movie or at least a decent cool calculated one like the first Wick movie. If you just want action and brainless fighting, go ahead. Also 7.7 hell no. 5/10 at most but I detest this illogical crap with plot armor, so 3/10 for me.",

        "text": "Lately, the action genre has grown tiresome. Filled with stunts but amateur acting skills or plot line. After last year's disappointing Skyscraper we have the return of John Wick or in this case John Wick 3 - Parabellum. Keanu Reeves is back as the professional assassin, but this time he's the one hunted.I loved this movie. John Wick 3 is everything an action movie should be. We don't just want to see fights, but we want to experience the suspense and dare I say have decent acting. Keanu Reeves is everything we want and need in an action star. He's naturally handsome but intelligent, strong but calculating. I loved the fact that they included new ways to kill someone. Hint, hint a library is not just for reading anymore. Some of us have waited for Halle Berry to make some better choices when it comes to movie roles. She deserves better, and we deserve better from the Oscar Winner. In John Wick 3, we get that. Her turn as Sofia isn't only sexy but powerful. She very much holds her own in the scenes she shares with Reeves. Other favorites are Lance Reddick as Charon and Ian McShane as Winston.Who said that hitmen couldn't be elegant as well as calculating? Jonathan Eusebio designed outstanding choreography for the fight scenes, especially the ones that occur in the latter end of the movie. Honorable mention goes to Boban Marjanovic aka backup center for the Philadelphia 76ers. His screen time may be short but memorable. We must also give props to Luca Mosca for his costumes. I love how he dressed the women in this movie. Asia Kate Dillion as the Adjudicator wouldn't have come across as menacing if it wasn't for the wardrobe. The tailoring of Reddick and McShane also helped convey their characters. Many a time we focus on the director, stunt team when it comes to these types of movies overlooking costuming. Mosca choices helped carry the story and along with the set design of Letizia Santucci and David Schlesinger. John Wick 3 is not just an action film but a mood.John Wick 3 may be the last one, but I am open to seeing Berry's character Sofia along with those two K 9's get a spin-off. It may be May, but John Wick 3 has kicked off Summer Movies at least the Action Division.Scale: It gets an 8 for sheer fun.Diversity: It has a variety of people of color from Asian to Black. The women aren't just eye candy but are an integral part of the story. It receives an 8.5",

Keanu is brilliant as always, and Parabellum really tops of the trifecta that is the John Wick triology like a cherry on top of a marvelous vanilla icecream.Set, camera work, lighting, sound and acting are all top class.And the true up and coming star in this one is the exellent Asia Kate Dillon. One could be under the impression that the actor is merely a woman with short hair. But no, \"they\" (as is the correct pro-noun) is non-binary. A truly refreshing breeze in the otherwise gender-stale Hollywood.Halle Berry doesn't look a day older than 50 thanks to her new, very tasteful I may ad, facial surgery.This really is a no-brainer. Go see it!Quentins new flick or The Joker really got nothing on this movie.If Keanu Reeves doesn't earn an Oscar for his part the academy really has lost all their credability.",

On the other hand it was disappointing with prolonged, cheesy fight scenes to very unlikeable final foe. For these reason i would consider this movie slightly below average.Final score: 4/10",

Yesterday, the digital print came out and the movie is a superb blockbuster. Thrilling actions, fast acting, good storyline made this movie one of the best action movie of all time.\nThough, I think John Wick 2 was better in storyline and action as well. Though John Wick 3 had great action sequences, with superb gun violence, I think that the action scene in John wick 2 after he is escaping after doing the task, had much better thrilling actions. The use of guns with accurate precision and the fast moving was good and real and first time such a thing was seen on movie. John wick 3 though had such scenes, they were merely a better copy of previous ones.\nNot to mention, that John Wick 3 too had some major interesting action scenes (never seen before), they just didn't have you goosebumps. If you hadn't seen any John Wick movie and see this movie, you will be like, \" Whoa! That is damn superb duperb action here\" .\nOverall, the only reason I give this movie 9 is because John Wick is a solid man. He takes a decision , he stands by it. I think that here John Wick's character has been throughly compromised just so that the fans could have a small twist.\nAnd even if John like others could get confused , there is surely a better way to show it rather than just Yes in one scene and No in another. I literally think, that one or two flashbacks might have done it.",

Keanu's practical work elevates already fantastic choreography leading to so many memorably moments. My favourite scenes had to be the end fight at the continental and the dog scene, both had fantastic lighting and music to aid.My critisicms for the film begin with the calm period at the middle and the ending, the latter is something that is growing on me. My problem with the calm is that it feels quite pointless is retrospect and feels like a screeching halt to a fast paced fun experience.Overall I am satisfied and happy with how this film turned out and I am interested in where else the series goes from here (may or may not). I adore good action and a nice fun experience that isn't annoying or obnoxious. I am happy to say this makes John Wick a complete trilogy.",

This was the first John Wick movie I've seen in theaters and the experience is way better then watching at home. Watching with an audience just makes the already great movie even better. The action is non stop and jaw dropping to say the least. It could have been that I was in a theater but this movie seemed most intense. The gun shots were loud and you could feel every bullet, every stab, every kick, and every punch. Halle Berry stole her action seen with a physical performance I wasn't expecting. I don't know how I feel about the ending. This is the kind of movie where if you think about the plot to much you can get annoyed. But the John Wick series is based off amazing action with thin plots and and this movie delivers with the best action in the whole series. I highly recommend seeing this movie in theaters.",

So many guys get killed, that they had to have many killed in the same way, because they ran out of ideas on how to kill them.\nIf watching unfiltered violence for 2.5 hours on end is your thing, you will love this movie. Otherwise avoid it like the plague!",

        "text": "Finally watched this last night, I was so hyped up for this movie. The 1st is a 10/10 and the 2nd is an 8/10 for me.Action is full throttle right from the get go, and then it continues, and it never ends. What makes John Wick 1 so special? The stakes were high, but the film was grounded in it's reality. You felt John Wick was still just a man, he could die, he could get injured.Throw that all away for Chapter 3. John Wick is an invincible wrecking ball, the story is no longer able to hold my sense of disbelief as apparently every person around the entire Earth is part of the high table assassin group, ready to die to John Wick as another faceless henchman. After 30 minutes you start to realize that the fight scenes in this film are pointless, they become boring as there is nothing at stake. The action is good, but it is nothing new, it becomes utterly pointless and you begin to ask yourself - what's the point of this?There isn't one. There is no story in this movie. I'd warn you of spoilers but there is nothing to spoil, the story is that John Wick is on the run from the organization he used to serve. That is it with a non-sensical twist in the last 3 minutesUgh, such a let down. The producers obviously want this to be a SkyFall franchise, they will continue this crap forever with cliff hangers until this franchise has lost all of its merit. A recent interview with the writer/director shows that he has no intention of wrapping this story up or creating a satisfying ending for our protagonist.The movie has some good cinematography, action scenes, and Keanu plays his part good. 5 star rating is generous but I still do like this franchise and hope they can turn it around.",

I thought John Wick adds hardly a story, no character development, no misplaced drama, no misplaced humor, nothing of that. What John Wick offers is action, action and more action. In fact, it is one long action scene.\nBut that is not a problem. The directors promise action and deliver. While delivering they made it look good and convincing, without trying to be more, and they're smart enough to give the movie a satisfying beginning and exciting ending.\nKeanu Reeves is a horrible actor. And his blank expressions is perfect for this movie.\nThe most that I love in this movie is Halle Berry or Sofia and her dogs.I think she did one of the best job portraying and playing the most memorable female assassin.\nSoundtrack was wonderful. It was created the perfect atmosphere in a particular scene.Anyhow, I believe it is a must see for action fans and for anyone looking for something a bit different from the usual fare.",

The choreographers did a great job, and the little to no use of stuntmen is great. The story is simple, you don't really need to understand the story to enjoy the movie, the action alone is worth enough to watch this movie. The gore is alright, but it might be too much for some of you. Some fight scenes are hilarious in a good way, and that's just an icing on the cake. I truly reccomend this.",

        "text": "The filmmakers of John Wick: Chapter 3 are well aware of how good their film looks. The credits at the end of the film play over a ballet montage, a fitting tribute to the stylish combat we've just witnessed. One of Wick's opponents asks him to confirm that \"the fight was pretty good\"; Wick growls back a \"yeah\". Self-awareness aside, there's really nothing to criticize here. John Wick 3 contains simply the best choreography I've ever seen. The stunt work is brilliant, and the actors collide in ways that go beyond merely satisfying to also feel right in every moment. It's perfectly convincing: there's a new standard for directing action scenes and we can only hope future directors take notes.All of the action is greatly enhanced by the brilliant camerawork and beautiful cinematography. Both are among the best I've seen in an action film. It's common to hear complaints about modern action scenes being muddled or ugly. There's none of that here. These scenes were perfectly edited. The physical layout of each location was fully established and the cuts were just fast enough to increase my heart rate without becoming confusing. I knew where all of the principals were the entire time. As all this suggests, when it comes to the execution of the action portions of the film, the third entry in this series is superb and even better than the first two. The set pieces are consistently clever, too, such as when an on-the-run Wick ducks into a museum of antique weapons.So if you're after more Wick, you'll probably enjoy this film. However, I also want to talk about how part of it didn't work for me. I'm sure some will see it differently; the difficulty is that what works is something that varies quite a bit from person to person. That said, one thing I really liked about the first two films in the series is how fun they were. The first two Wick films were situated about halfway between your standard light-hearted action fare and the sort of wild action thriller I'm talking about. This film is darker and more violent. There are plenty of films that redeem a bunch of over-the-top action violence by portraying it in a kind of goofy or winking way; films I love like Mandy or many films by Quentin Tarantino fit this category. Wick 3 has the over-the-top action, but it doesn't wink at you during these scenes.This isn't reflected in its rating in the United States (the MPAA knows no nuance), but in British Columbia (Canada) the new film goes from a 14A to an 18A. The Wick series is not a beast of drama or complexity: any wrinkles in the story are in the service of entertainment. So I question the writing decision to move the series in the direction of fairly horrific killings and mutilations. These moments are mostly not fun. They're not cases of the movie elbowing you and saying, \"hey, isn't this the kind of thing that only a movie can do?\", as Tarantino does in Django Unchained.So I'd have preferred the movie to be just as wild and well-made as it turned out to be, but a touch more light-hearted as well. You can have all the brilliant filmmaking you'd like, but the movie still has to work as entertainment, and in that regard it slips a bit compared to the previous two films. When parts of an action film stop being fun, it starts to drag, and I was ready for it to wrap up about 30 minutes before it ended. I'm sure there are people for whom the film in its entirety will work, and that's great. For me, however, it wasn't quite the fun ride of the first two.",

I'm just shocked we saw so much violence and action, we'd never have guessed this would have happened, especially after watching the second one.Ok, let me get serious. Usually we get to a 3rd film and it becomes a bit dry, the plot is a bit lost, the scenes become boring, basically it just becomes a 3rd installment for the sake of it. But with John Wick 3, it was none of that. It had twists and turns, the action was fast paced, the choreography was probably the best I've ever seen, basically it was absolutely brilliant. The only reason I didn't give it a 10 was because John Wick 2 was a 10 and nothing beats that. But I absolutely loved this film.John Wick fans will not be disappointed. This is the perfect 3rd installment, one that will have you talking about it for a while.",

The second one went a bit deeper into that trying to move things around, and now Parabelleum has built on the previous 2 movies in a way that it expands things and even makes way for a 4th movie.John Wick 3 has got a good cast, good story and great scenes that would make you want to hit the rewind button in the cinema... oh yeah amazing fight scenes tooThe movie brings to mind The Raid Redemption, and it certainly was great seeing the villains from the two Raid movies in this one.If you thought John Wick 1&2 were good movies, then you'd certainly love this one",

The action starts from the first minute and continues until the end - there lies its drawback. The choreography is phenomenal in the first and second big fights and fizzles out by the end where the \"boss battle\" feels unenthused and slow paced. The final battle is also similar to the idea they used in the second film which feels a little lazy and unoriginal.\nHalle Berry's role is great but is easily overshadowed by her dogs which are badass.\nOverall the film has plenty of action and inventive kills but it is far too long, you could definitely take a good 10 minutes out of the fight at the end.\nWould still recommend and would watch again.",

The colouring in this film is completely sumptuous, perfectly bedazzling us with the non-stop action as John once more has to escape the clutches of high-flown power.The film has lots of nice little in-jokes visually that refer to the previous two films which means you can easily give JW3 a re-watch to see if you can find these subtleties. Keanu and Halle are perfection, brilliant performers who have that fundamentally true star quality to make you believe the character, not do a double viewing of what you think the actor is trying to so, which is so prevalent in action films these days.If you need a pick me up to get your adrenaline going on a Sunday night, definitely give this film a watch. It's better to have watched after 1 and 2, but you could easily watch this in isolation and enjoy it.",

For me this is by far the best john wick movie, action and story wise. There was never a dull moment in the movie and i was at my edge all times. I am happy they ended it with the possibility for future sequels. Go watch the movie.",

        "text": "Being a big fan of John Wick 1 and 2, especially Chapter 2, I had high hopes for number 3. I liked it but there was too much shooting choreography then plot/story. In between John Wick killing everyone in his way, there's little spaces for the story lines here and there. The movie didn't need Halle Berry, any other woman would of been good in that role, even an unknown actress might of been better. I really wanted more development history regarding the Continental and the High Table. We get glimpse of it through the eyes of the female \"adjudicator\" who is an agent that has the last word.\nBottom line, you get the action you'd expect after seeing 1 and 2 but just too much for my taste. Though the choreography's are extremely well done just as expected. Those fight scenes definitely had the stunt doubles busy but you can see that Keanu Reeves has done a lot's training and for sure it will remain with him via muscle memory. I like how the ending leaves a window open for a John Wick 4.\n7 Stars out of 10, still very worth seeing!",

There's plenty of killing and violence, but if you ask me the fight scenes were entirely too long and became boring. Then the story would move a little and things would get better, then another too long fight would come up. All this movie appears to be is a filler between Chapter 2 and Chapter 4. They could have shortened it to about 20 minutes and combined it with the next Chapter.",

There was just too much of it to the point that it became mind numbing and it seemed like the whole point of the show was to see how high the body count was. This displayed a major weakness in the film. Once again, poor screen writers took what could have been a really good movie, and turned it into just an average movie. There has to be a reason to kill other than just to see how many we can kill in the allotted time. Thus it only gets a 6 rating from me.",

The action scenes were brutal as usual but I felt like they were sloppily executed in terms of choreography and how much meaningless action scenes were added. A sign of a good action scene is if it gets you at the edge of your seat and shows you character/s. Some action scenes just had me so confused if this movie was actually a comedy action movie. I think I liked it better when the action scenes were rougher and more raw. Keanu Reeves still carries John Wick pretty well as a character but some of the fight scenes felt too pretentious. But there were still a lot of pretty cool scenes.As for the plot, it wsn't as good as the previous two but I was okay with that. When the second movie ended, I had zero idea how they were going to go from there to the next movie. And I felt like they didn't have much idea either.The first and second act was boring and confusing. The new characters were meh but the third act was okay. Even though this third film wasn't as great as I wanted a John Wick film to be or just a film to be, I'm still looking forward to the next movie and hope that it turns out great not like this. If anything, this film is a good setup for the next one.",

Even Halley Berry comes across as semi-believable.\nKeanu is starting to show his age at a few point and not as quick as he used to be.\nAs with most of the films in the genre, it suffers from Magic- clips, which only seem to be changed as punctuation to the action rather than a necessity. I will give the director points for scattering a few moments of focus on mitigating it with shots of speed loading techniques during non-critical moments.Fight Stuttering: At several points the opponents are clearly waiting for Keanu to make the next move, and I blame the stunt guy and fight choreographer for those moments. They got highly skilled fight performers (very quick moves). At moment the pace of the fight stutters, deviating from what looks good on camera.\nHand to Hand: Certainly not Donnie Yen level which the performers seem trained for, but still well above the usual US action movie fair like that Mercenary Tough-guy trilogy which I also like.\nSpecial credit for a knife throwing sequence where it takes several thrown knives to drop attackers, instead of the magic one killing instantly.The dialogue for the most part works and serves to keep the story moving, until Act 4 where the writers seem to wander with the 'Fan-boy' Ninja antagonist, a part which seems to have been cut down for length, or not working like they wanted.Some improves for #4 would be not to dwell on action sequences (a rule that was broken during the Boss fight), that is the Strength of the John Wick Series.",

        "text": "It's been 2 years since I first watched John Wick, after it being recommended countless times by some of my friends and being showered with rave reviews by critics. Most of the time, films don't really catch up to such levels of hype but the original was so good that it compelled me to go watch the second part.I won't go into spoiler territory but you should definitely treat your senses to the adrenaline-pumping films if you haven't already, ASAP.\nIf you have indeed seen both of the previous films, JW3 starts right from the events concluding JW2 and while the starting is a bit jarring and a large portion of the first half is a bit forgettable, evident by my poor recollection of the events. (or I just have a poor memory haha)Thankfully, it doesn't take much time for the film to regain steam and start firing from all cylinders.You see, cinematography has always been a plus point of the franchise. Now, combine it with immaculately planned action scenes, daunting stunts, quirky characters and (insanely) deep lore and you would get a god-tier action flick.Pardon me if I talk in superlatives here but John Wick is one of the rare film franchises which manage to consistently amaze me with their sheer ingenuity. All three films are based on simplicity, with the main confilct arising from a puppy. But how the films choose to present this is what appeals to me. While the main story threatens to wear thin, the director Chad Stahelski has created a huge, lusciously-crafted network operated Assassins and MNC-type organisations which essentially kill but with a moral code. The Continental Hotel is a prime example of this kind of world-building, which itself is expanded with branches all over the world, operating under the aegis of the High Table (which has become the main antagonist in the franchise)Speaking in terms of food analogies, this is the side-dish/dessert but the main course is the jaw-droppingly insane action sequences. It's like every film keeps getting better and better vis-a-vis the magnitude of the action set-pieces. Aided by the brilliant camera work of Dan Lausten, they action is swift, merciless and just, 'cool'. It's really good.Unfortunately, the strength of the film is also one of its biggest weaknesses. You see, Parabellum does become overkill. VERY OVERKILL. By the end of the movie, one might just get action fatigue. The sheer amount of people slain by John Wick is dizzyingly high. Slish-slash-sloosh, and everyone's dead. Out of the hundreds and thousands of skilled assassins and amateurs that come at Wick, not one is able to kill him.I guess, that's the whole point of the film and to its credit, it does poke at the action tropes of invincibility. It's evidently self-aware of its ridiculousness and while that's a good thing, one cannot help but be overwhelmed by the macabre attributes of the film. Blood splattered stylishly is blood splattered nevertheless.Ultimately, John Wick is still one heck of a movie, oozing with swagger, charm and smarts! A must watch for all action-aficionados and with a word-of-caution, the average movie goer.",

        "text": "The first two John Wick movies I saw back-to-back. The first one was just good enough, and the second one was stylish, but on the average mark due to it's uneven pacing. They were fun-enough action films with a nice performance from Keanu Reeves and amazing fight choreography, however, and this one was getting some very rave reviews.So I watched it when I had the chance, and I have to say: THIS is exactly what I've been wanting from a fight-heavy action film. THIS is what I was expecting from the first two but didn't quite get. This one however, improves on the flaws of both of it's prequels, with better fight choreography, better visual style, stronger emotion, a faster pace, and genuine, kinetic charisma. This flick is truly an adrenaline-fuelled thrill ride, with tons of energy packed into it, and is one of the most exciting movies I have ever seen in my whole life.The story isn't great, or anything (until the end), and there aren't exactly many complexities being set up, and most of the scenes and the characters are just there with literally no purpose for the film except the action. But that's fine, because this film is just a showcase of visual grandeur and brilliant choreography. Which it is.This movie romanticised action in a way I have not seen before, treating it as a beautiful art form. There are some scenes involving ballet in this movie, which really felt powerful in its contribution to ensuring fighting as an art. I don't know why. I liked it way more than I think was intended, as I did for the whole film. It felt so much more powerful, and so much more emotionally thrilling than the others- I really felt every hit in this film, and it really kept the adrenaline pumping, along with it's much more steady pace.In fact, I was tempted to even give this movie a 4.5/5, but there were some very odd moments were the fights weren't as perfect as they could have been, which was really weird as everything else was. The very last, very dramatic fight scene at the end, for example should've finished with a series of dramatic close-ups, rather than finishing from a long shot, making it lack the power needed. Along with this, some scenes had fights in places filled with many objects scattered about, and it would have been great to see these objects used. Like I said, many scenes do this, but when one or two scenes don't- it just feels so unsatisfying.But the film still works very well. It's a lot more dynamically bloodthirsty, a lot more beautiful and it works as a stylised neo-noir just as well as it works as an over-the-top action flick. The kinetic energy of the film is so well placed that even the fights create emotion, making it exactly what a John Wick film needs to be.I mean, he kills a guy with a book, he rides a horse on the highway, and he uses a katana on a motorbike. And the he is the effortlessly charismatic Keanu Reeves. What more could you ask for?CONCLUSION:\n'John Wick: Chapter 3- Parabellum' does almost everything it should be, with beautiful direction and yet again outstanding fight choreography, making this one of the most exciting and dynamic films to date, even if it's at the cost of depth.",

Especially silenced subway clash scene. It was absurdly fun.\nAs for this movie,it lost his John Wick soul. It's like a circus show until its last scene. The sequences are inconsistently disconnected from each other. \"Hey, let's add a sequence that takes place in the barn. - Yeah dude, cool idea. - What about oriental set up? - Crazy!!\" It's like a fairground with random elements. The actions sequences are repetitives just the place is changing. In fact, Halle Berry keeps killing people with the same tactic. The story loses its meaning at some point.John's journey becomes completely meaningless.Here in those scenes I was really tired of watching the movie.Half-wise, knife-bearing men rush to the armed professional assassins. The only scene I really like in the movie is John's well choreographed fight with the twins.\nTo get to the point, if you really want to see John kill those who run at him, watch it, otherwise you won't miss a lot.",

I can't describe the feeling in words, but I must say, this is easily Top 10 for me. They couldn't have done it any better. However, to the critics-Yeah you can call it silly at certain points, but remember IT'S A MOVIE. I'm ready to sacrifice realism as long as I get entertained. I mean that's the point right:for the movie to be able to sell to the audience, the most ridiculous stunts and make it look cool at the same time. And not only did this movie do that, but it totally beat my expectations. Can't wait for the sequel, 2021 feels so far away",

Middle of the movie could have easily been cut out and nothing would be amiss.First two movies had a good balance of believable fights and story. This one is just pure action which starts fast and never lets down. CGI is I feel more obvious than in previous titles as well. So all in all, dumb fun but not even close to first two movies.",

My main issue with most movies similar to John wick are that most of the fight scenes have to many cuts so you can barely see what's going on. John wick doesn't have this issue in any of its action scenes.Every fight scene is fun, exciting and a massive thrill ride, there are also just the right amount of fight scenes so they don't fill like director just randomly threw some in with no thought or reason other than just to keep the viewer entertained, also each location that the fight scene is filmed in is very different from the last and that helps keep all the fight scenes fresh and exciting to watch.The movie also does a great job establishing each character and there motivations, another reason why John wick as a character stands out is because of some brilliant acting from Keanu reeves. One of my issues is the plot, it feels like they really could of done something great with it but instead stuck with some generic revenge story, but something that stops this from being a glaring issue is that the films realises and makes sure that the story is easy to follow.William Defoe is absolutely fantastic in this film and feels perfect for the role. There were a few characters that I didn't feel we're not necessary\nOverall this film has some fantastic world building, mostly great acting and brilliant fight scenes make this movie great watch.",

I was surprised by Asia Kate Dillon, and then embarrassed by her neck tattoo. \"Einfühlung\" sounds German, but it's not an actual word. What a shame. If you can't do it, just don't.",

        "text": "Viewpoints based on production, audience, and acting.Opening Statement:\nMe and my friends would debate like crazy in college. \"Who would win in a battle to the death if it came down to it? John Wick or Jason Bourne?\" Although both protagonists share the commonality of being hunted by their own inner circles, I always personally voted John Wick, and for these reasons.Production Viewpoints:\nFrom the production and filming standpoint, John Wick has the ability to hold minimal dialogue due to the nonstop action and extremely well orchestrated fight scenes. The intensity is so high, that despite the low amount of dialogue, people still feel like they're inside of the movie themselves and the action speaks for itself. I also want to acknowledge the quality in sound effects and eye catching visual awe with the various locations filming took place. Music in all three movies never fails to match the emotion of what the audience should feel during each scene. The story itself would be my only suggestion to build clarity upon. Although there's the obvious notion that we have a man who faces all odds against him in a circle of the most elite assassins, I think the audience would enjoy learning more in depth, about the origins of this league of assassins, and how John Wick became entangled in this circle of killers that he struggles to escape.Audience Viewpoint:\nFrom an audience's perspective, John Wick has the effect of making people in the movie theater get excited and cheer out loud regardless of the expectations to be quiet during the film- which in my opinion is the number one goal of making any action movie! Other action films such as Jason Bourne, 007, or Mission Impossible, although they are always usually pretty well done, don't seem to have that same effect on the crowd of strangers who come together after seeing absolute havoc caused by the protagonist. The audience loved the hard and fast paced violence mixed with the interesting story and mystery behind \"The Boogeyman\" or John Wick.Acting:\n(Keanu Reeves, Halle Berry, Asia Kate Dillon, Mark Dacascos)\nThe acting for all working artists was very spectacular, but I am crediting these 4 due to the attention they really brought to my eye.Keanu Reeves' is undoubtedly the one and only John Wick. His ability to execute fight scenes and illicit emotion is always very well done. When watching, you can tell he's a lone wolf who's been betrayed by his own. You can really see the death and danger that lurks in his eyes, and also looks the part alongside to the fury he brings to each encounter being a protagonist manifested from pain. He carries out each scene exceptionally, and proves that a great action movie shouldn't need a lot of dialogue.Halle Berry, playing Sofia, blew me away. I read that she trained with her dogs in the movie for all of allegedly 7 months, which speaks for a dedicated actress in the industry not to mention, one many wouldn't expect to see in a John Wick film. My only suggestion would be that she reload a bit more in the firefights, but other than that, she really exceeded my expectations in conducting what one could call \"the female John Wick\" perhaps.Asia Kate Dillon, playing the role of \"The Adjudicator\" really was interesting to me and she sold the part perfectly. I've never saw her in another film, but my first impression of her character was \"Woah, she is one weird person\" which was what I feel like the writers really wanted to convey to the audience. Her monotone voice and essentially playing a role where she needed to present herself as inhuman and a robot like equalizer of the high table who seemed to show no emotions, was done magnificently.Mark Dacascos, playing the role of \"Zero\", was a huge standout in the film. Although he was one of the primary antagonists, his ability to fight was sublime and unlike anything I've seen before. He matched the character well, and also was able to illicit emotion as an actor to a great extent. His dialogue was on point, but his speed and skill set with fighting and orchestrating as the other \"alpha male\" became worthy of noting.Summary:\n\"John Wick 3: Parabellum\" in my eyes, is still, and always has been, the embodiment of the perfect Hollywood action production throughout all three movies thus far. The story has mystery and suspense, the actors sync well to their roles while also playing the roles great, sound effects are on point, fight scenes never disappoint, and I always see a reaction from the audience unlike any other. People love what John Wick is all about if they appreciate the art of great high intensity action film making. Who knows what John Wick 4 is going to bring to the table... and maybe... \"the high table.\" A job well done.",

In fact, one of Big Johns best weapons is a horse that kicks bad guys in the head on command. Big Johns command of course.\nApparently bad guys can be stabbed, shot and mutilated dozens of times, and still get back up and continue fighting!\nBUT... not after being kicked in the head by a horse. Statistics show that a hundred times more bad guys die, every year, from being kicked in the head by a horse than all other modes of murder combined! Look it up!\nUnfortunately, horses are hard to hide in your pocket or pant waist :( Yet, the numbers of bad guys being murdered, all over the world, by brutal horse kicks to the head continues to rise at alarming rates.I'll sum up my thoughts regarding the movie with a Keanu Reeves quote;\"What would happen if you melted?\" (or your brain melted from watching too many Big John movies) Keanu continues with his contemplation of melting by stating,\"You know, you never hear this talked about much, but spontaneous combustion? It exist!\"Sound thoughts to live by indeed for - What would happen if you melted?\nPerhaps Keanu, the self appointed spokesperson for the existence of spontaneous human combustion will share the answer in his next movie.\nThe never ending saga of John Wick - and his horse.",

That's not all though, it's got plenty of non-gun fights - swords, knives, hand fight, etc. And, dogs are not behind too when it comes to action.The first half an hour was epic. The tension, the action, the clock ticking until the second John Wicks is officially ex-communicado, and what follows. Can't recall such a strong and entertaining opening of a movie in recent memory.So many scenes which look more like a shooter game which is mental. But most action movies are mental anyway, aren't they? Again, it's not gun fights only. John Wick rides a beautiful horse as well as a sports bike which is one of his real life passions.A very interesting closing which has nicely setup the scene for the next chapter of the franchise, which should be even more explosive considering who will face each other and what will be at stake.",

The weapons action was incomparable.And speaking of scripts and dialogue, the limiting factor is Reeves acting ability, so expect humorless video game level dialogue, but with all the action...who cares!",

Over the top, down right ridiculous, actual neck breaking.Sadly, it may also be the least impacting, story wise. The narrative strongly reflected a push for a 4th installment, that felt as if this was decided halfway through filming a finalized trilogy.But all the hard work that went into all the incredible combat, makes you glad you came out for another go with BaBaYaga. And the canine tag team scene, showcasing an impressive Halle Berry, is one of the most unique peaces of cinema adrenaline ever filmed.If this is your bag, you gotta give it a go. But if you aren't much of a fan of the 1st 2 JWs, skip it, and/or wait till it's available for at home viewing.",

        "rating": 8,
        "date": "2019-05-19",
        "text": "Having never watched either of the first two John Wick installments, I took a risk and decided to watch the latest Chapter 3 - Parabellum yesterday. I think it helped not having expectations, preconceived notions, or a frame of reference of the other two films. Given that the franchise's director, Chad Stahelski, has an accomplished background as a stunt coordinator, it was easy to gauge what this filmmaker aimed to achieve: forgoing a complex story and illuminating complex action.With those goals in mind, I came away thoroughly impressed and entertained. The stunt work and choreography are just downright amazing. The editing was crisp and easy to follow. No barrage of quick and dizzying cuts. The narrative is sparse and minimal in line with Mad Max: Fury Road. The authenticity is a small step down from Mission: Impossible - Fallout, but a huge step up from anything Marvel has produced. The multitudes of set pieces are stunning. The neon-soaked night sequences look gorgeous on screen.This film's backbone is clearly hyper-stylized violence. Death permeates in massive numbers with no shortage of blood spilled. Video game fans - or at least those familiar with renowned titles - will recognize the visual and stylistic inspirations. There are blatant parallels between this movie and the melee ferocity of Mortal Kombat or the rapid fire pacing of a first-person shooter. Lives lost rarely - if ever - induce any amount of cathartic response. The shear volume of kills is nothing short of absurd, but this movie - like its gaming counterparts - works because it basks in the absurdity.In other cinematic universes, there is a tendency to interject the story with massive amounts of exposition. We learn about the intricacies of the past, people, places and events through dialogue and revelation. In the John Wick universe, mystery is the allure. The less we know about the High Table, the clandestine assassin organization that operates within the shadows, the more captivating the universe becomes. Characters like Sofia and the Director are seamlessly introduced into the narrative with veiled allusions to backstories, but never fully divulging any of the details. Perhaps it's part of a brilliant strategy to develop franchise spin-offs. It's this kind of withholding that made the original Star Wars franchise so compelling for engaging fan discussions and speculation.Some of the more glaring issues were the lack of any real perceivable threat to the protagonist coupled with the hero's near superhuman invincibility. Despite the countless legions of henchmen and boss men, it never seems at any point in the movie that John Wick is facing serious odds of failure over success. The question is never 'Will he survive this round', but rather 'How many different style points can he rack up on the fatalities score card.' Suspension of disbelief treads on shaky ground at times. In a short window of time, Wick absorbs brutal blows, lacerations and bullet wounds. The laws of physics often teeter between reality and fantasy. Just how many collisions with moving vehicles and freefalls from atop buildings can one man endure?I've noticed an interesting shift in recent years with film directors operating within the action and blockbuster realms. Where the backgrounds once leaned more toward the storyteller and artist as helmer, there now seems to be a growing preference for the technician and craftsman. Consider the likes of Brad Bird (animation), Tim Miller (visual effects) and Stahelski (stunts) leading big-budgeted projects Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol, Deadpool and the John Wick series respectively. These hires seem to indicate a growing studios push toward style and technique over narrative and drama. Time will tell if this strategy leads to an evolution of filmmaking or homogenous cultural output.",

His hard work that he put into preparation to this series was surely payed off, in my opinion it is safe to say that Keanu is the best action actor in the world. Moreover John Wick is series that is realistic, very very improbable but yet realistic I love this aspect about this movie.",

But, it was really just as simple as John being excommunicato and he is supposed to be the best of the best so he's just trying to survive. Yes, there could have been some kind of character growth, I'll agree to that. However, the fight scenes, as unrealistic as some are (let's face it, most high action movies have unrealistic fights and stunts), were pretty original and cool in my opinion. Especially the dogs scene, which was my favorite. They had to think outside the box here after the last 2 movies, and I think they accomplished that. I loved all the movies in the franchise. I'm not sure about a 4th with the way this one ended. I feel like they might be pushing it now, but no one can kill John Wick. I had my doubts about a 3rd with overkill, but I really enjoyed this film. Based on the reviews being so black and white, you'll have to judge for yourself.",

Chad Stahelski and team had great vision in this movies and they successful create this John Wick universe became one of the best action movies in couple of decades. The choreography was well written and acted, the stunt performer was really professional martial artist and Keanu Reeves was incredibly amazing!! I need to watch this movies twice in cinema because there is so many details in every scene that easily missed, every action was beautifully captured. Well done!",

But sure i will explain what i'm traying to say .\nFirst of all i will split the headline :\nIncredible , perfect ! Yes actually it's ! If i will consider it as a one movie without any chapters before or without any previous movies related to this movie !! If it's a one movie i will say its perfect ! The fights , the moves , the killing scenes , espically the the shotguns scene .. it was legendary and finally .. the music was great and they played it at critical moments and before big moments ! ! Keanu's act and his accurate shots was unbelievable , i mean it seems he trained a lot to be at this level .Now let me explain the second part of the headline :\nReverse the content of the previous two parts , there is no storyline !! NO any story in the movie ! It was just killing .. killing .. killing , action .. action .. action ! When i was watching the movie i asked myself until when ?? Until when they will stop the killing scenes or the action ? Unlimited ??\nWhen we watched the 2 previous movies of john wick film series ! We are used to see a story in the movie ! In the first chapter john wick wanted to get revenge from the killers of his dog which was a gift from his wife andto get revenge from the theifs of his car !\nIn the chapter 2 of john wick .. john wick wanted to get revenge from santino d'antonio ! I mean still there has been a story ! But in chapter three for the god sake all i saw was just blood , guns , kills , i mean it was boring and repetitive ! Hope you will change the main idea in the movie when you produce ch.4 .. i hope to see at least some conversations in chapter 4 😅\nFinally , most importantly .. find and create a story in chapter 4",

The overall feel of this instalment is to make more money and continue a so far successful franchise even if the cost and potential of what this movie could have been.I will not go into lengths about how long and at times unrealistic the fight scenes were (it's all ready covered by others). I will note that perhaps the reason why John Wick does seem to be impervious too bullets is his bulletproof suit? But still, at the end of the movie it becomes a little ridiculous how unscathed he gets through it all.My main problem with the plot of this movie is that it becomes painful obvious that what should have been one movie have been split into two. The ending in this one could have been a great plot twist midway in a potentially great instalment, instead the rest have min saved for what I guess know will be John Wick 4. Instead of filling the two hours with maybe more background story of the universe the movie is sett in, Wicks background or the tables organisation structure it's just fighting, fighters and more fighting. A missed opportunity to engage viewers but that's just my opinion. Don't get me wrong, the action and thrills are the reason I enjoy this franchise but it would have been nice too see a plot driven action movie instead of a fighting tournament with some plot sprinkled on top.",

A whole new masacre with very creative scenes that makes all the killing not seem repetitive.It is defenitely worth watching and also deserves to be a John Wick, different than for example Matrix 2 and 3. However even when one loves Keanu Reaves or doesnt exactly care much about the quality of the movie and just wants to enjoy pure action, one still has to notice a lot of illogical stuff in many scenes. It is obviously hard to write a character that kills hundreds of people, who themselves are masters at killing, but limit him to human strenght and longevity, while John Wick concerning the later has seemingly more lives than we do.Jokes aside in the later part we also encounter a scene with very bad, i mean seriously bad acting, which kinda ruined the experience to some degree, but with all honesty the movie got worse near the end, while the ending was great again.I myself dont care to much about these weird logic involving some scenes and the bad acting scene, which is why i give this movie a 8.",

Yes there are elements which are a straight continuation from the first two films, but what impressed me is that the film didn't rely on them. There's new ideas here and they were well executed (pun intended).Standard brawls and mini fights are a plenty but as I say the film didn't over rely on them. There was nothing goofy about these, they were quick, intense and they moved you swiftly through. The more showpiece fight scenes really do show off a higher level of choreography planning but also the actual execution of both audio and visual was immense.Even the plot impressed me. I don't think anyone really watches John Wick films for the plot but in this one there is a bit more substance to it. At times it does catch you by surprise.There are seldom trilogies that improve with each film and depending on how you feel about the first two, this might be one of them.",

With even more insight into this fascinating universe and even more information about John's previous life before the movies began. The action is arguably the best that we've seen in the series so far, with fights ranging with horseback riding, motorcycle chases, and even dogs getting in on the fun to slow drawn out fights between two badasses with samurai swords. Parabellum has at least something to offer everyone who go to see it whether it's violent action, or more insight into john's life, John Wick chapter 3 is a definite must see",

Same as the other 2 movies with more great creative fights and stunts.\nThat is what the Wick movies are... All stunts, if you don't like it then don't see it. However if you do want a great fun \"badass\" movie and appreciate how difficult all those fight scenes were to do then THIS MOVIE IS PERFECT.",

What I didn't get was any of charm of the original. The first John Wick made me care about John. It was such a wonderful introduction to the rich underworld he from which he eacaped. This one seemed to be far more about impressive fight scenes than anything else, which is not the reason....or the only reason to enjoy a John Wick film. Keanu Reeves seemed to be phoning it in too. He was even more emotionless than usual. The fight scenes really are amazing, but everything else was....meh.",

Hint, great action movie is not about having only great action. People who don't read books should not be allowed to make movies, simple as that. Making John Wick to appear as a mentally challenged was interesting twist, but how can I feel sympathy or even remotely identify myself through hero?",

        "text": "I really enjoyed the first two movies with their simplistic plots and incredible action scenes that focused primarily on gun play. The third installment of this franchise stayed true to its simplistic plot and the scenes that focused on close quarters gun combat were outstanding as usual, but there was more of an emphasis on hand to hand combat this time around. Sometimes hand to hand combat movies are amazing if the choreography is done right (see the raid and the raid 2 for example). Yet in this movie you had professional martial-artists in the same frame as Keanu Reeves and the difference between them was very obvious. It didn't seem believable that John Wick could beat any of the other characters on screen in hand to hand combat. The reason he won those fights wasn't because he was more of a skilled fighter, he just has some pretty thick plot armor (more so than the first two movies). In the first two films you believed he could win any fight because of what was shown on screen and the prefect choreography, but in Parabellum the choreography was too sloppy and maybe Keanu is getting a little old for hand to hand action scenes.",

        "text": "The highest compliment I can pay John Wick 3 is that it is a John Wick movie. And the key word is \"movie\" not \"sequel.\" It feels like an extension of the first two films, not an attempt at rehashing them. The John Wick franchise is known for it's excellent cinematography and choreography, it's fast paced action, and just for being incredibly fun. And Parabellum checks all those boxes.\nI've seen a lot of action films, and quite a few with long, seemingly endless fight sequences and a lot of them can start to feel boring if they go on too long. Yet, for all the fighting in the John Wick movies, I'm never bored. They always manage to keep it interesting with creative weapons, locations, villains, and fighting styles. It's astounding how fresh they've kept the action for three movies, and I feel certain they could keep that up, at least for a few more installment. This film does heavily sequel bait, much like the second film did, but, as with that, who cares, I'm gonna go see the next one. They earned it!\nSomething else I feel I might not have praised enough is the character designs. It's a world just different enough from our own that it feels like it could exist within the real world, but wholly apart from it. It's the type of world where tattooed androgynes are desk workers and fiery young Non-binary people with short, blue hair outrank old men in suits. The freaks are running the circus, so to speak.\nBut really, how much about this movie can I praise that I haven't already acknowledged in my other John Wick reviews. If you loved John Wick 1 and 2 as much as I did, 3 is exactly what you'll want. If, for some reason, you didn't like them, don't expect anything different from the third movie.",

Lots of guns.\" Parabellum is the third installment in the series and follows John Wick, as he's on the run with a $14 million bounty on his head. I was extremely excited for this film, and man I was blown away. The action sequences in this film are by far the best I have seen in any other film. It starts off fast paced and only manages to get even better. The opening fight sequence is one of the best action pieces I have ever seen. Keanu Reeves, again, is great, he's god. There's not that much dialogue in this film, but he's able to convey what John is feeling physically. Even the storyline itself was easy to follow without the dialogue. The action and physicality are able to paint and convey a clear and understandable story, which is action packed and intense. The only thing that I didn't like about this film is that it lacks the emotion, but it honestly didn't need it. In comparison, I'd say this is just as good as the first one, if not better. It has god tier action sequences that make this film badass, but it lacks the emotional punch that the first one has. I'd give John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum an A-\n🎬\n🎬\n🎬\nIf you liked this and want to see more, check out #dangitzjonahreviews and feel free to request something down below.

It's silly (not even minimally intelligent) action from beginning to the end, though very well executed and a wonderful work by the stunt team like the previous installments. There's so much action in the last act of the movie that I seriously got bored of it. There was no pause, no low time, I felt no impact or edging at all, and the hand to hand choreos were getting tiring and annoying by the minute.\nAt the very end of the movie, they just present us viewers with the most WTF moment of the trilogy, to the point of me, literally, facepalming myself.I absolutely loved the first movie, and this one in my honest opinion was absolutely the worst of the three.",

From the moment the movie opens, to the time the credits roll, there is very little downtime. How Keanu Reeves is able to do things other action stars his age have to have stunt doubles for amazes me! Theres even a few twists and the lore of the world is expanded upon even more for good measure. If you are fans or are invested in the saga, GO SEE THIS MOVIE, as the horse and the knife fights alone are woth the price of admission, and that's just the first 30 minutes...",

With an amount of $14 million on his head, he gets an army of mercenary killers behind him.The movie has a lot of fighting in an original way. This means that the perpetual killings are not bored but every fight is a fight in itself.It starts to become very unrealistic when you let John Wick jump through glass walls and he survive. There would have been more attention to the story of Johny Wick than just murders.Despite the criticisms, the movie gets an 8. The original fights in the movie make up a lot.",

        "text": "As the third installment in the electrifying series, the film has proved that each John wick continues to be better than the last. With breathtaking sound effects and incredibly realistic action sequences, you find yourself wanting more when you're finished watching, especially with actors that seem to fit their roles impeccably well.John Wick, Chapter 3 begins right where John Wick Chapter 2 left off. We find the man himself, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) being put under the clock to heal up, get supplies, and be prepared for the order of assassination placed on his head which starts at 14 million dollars. The beginning boasts some incredible action sequences which include a fight with a library book, a fight in a knife display room, and a chase seen which captures Wick riding a horse through New York City while avoiding gunshots and attacks from motorcyclists. All of these things happen within the first 45 minutes of the film. The movies plot takes a unique turn as well and transitions from focusing on john wick surviving his assassination to a rising rebellion against the \"high table,\" the group that runs the assassination organization. Watch, as John has to go from dealing with his own assassination to getting revenge on the organization willing to hurt and kill his closest friends.When watching the film in the comfy movie seats with popcorn in hand, expecting another john wick with great action sequences and a so-so plot, there was one thing that stuck out that I was not expecting to be such in impactful part of the film; the realistic sound was beyond anything I had ever heard. With every gun shot, a realistic and loud \"bang\" noise is made that vibrates your seat in the theater. This immersive experience is something that carries throughout the entire film through every gun shot.Every action sequence in the film has its own unique touches and they all feel different. With so many great moments in the film, these intense and riveting action sequences make up for the plot lacking any kind of serious morals. One of the action scenes that stood out to me was with John Wick and Sophia (Halle Berry). Sophia has dogs in the film which aid in fighting and are a crucial part of the action sequence. The camera rapidity pans from one of the dogs taking down one of the gunman to John Wick fighting somebody else. In a part of this sequence, there is a moment where John and one of the assassins both need to reload their weapons. They simultaneously drop their used bullet cartridges from their guns and both put their new cartridges in at the same time but then john wick is able to reset his weapon faster and shoot the other assassin before he can finish resetting his weapon. The shot had some incredible directing with both people doing the same hand motions in parallel together until John is able to finish faster and shoots the other. This scene, along with many others in the film, was the kind of scene that makes you say \"that was awesome.\"Another aspect of the film that stood out was how well the actors fit their roles. Keanu Reeves is not particularly a top notch actor, he often times overacts, and is too serious in his films. Where that would not work in something like a disney film, It works perfectly here. Reeves fits the role perfectly as a serious, brooding assassin who knows what is necessary to complete a film. many of the uncut sequences in the film are only possible because Reeves is able to reload and shoot weapons and make it look like he knows what he is doing. An actor with similar skills is Tom Cruise, in his Mission Impossible movies. Both Reeves and Cruise perform most of their own action scenes and don't have stunt doubles.The John Wick franchise is something that brings a new and fresh experience to cinema with its realistic action sequences, superb sound editing, and actors that continuously fit the roles they play. I can't help but feeling that this is just the beginning for John Wick despite it being the third film in the franchise.",

        "text": "Ahhh...John Wick. An easy-on-the-eyes assassin with a penchant for vengeance and gore, a hint of anti-heroism, and a sympathetic tortured past. Keanu Reeves is back as the title character for what is definitely one of his best movies since The Matrix, and this time, he managed to raise the stakes even higher. After killing a member of the High Table on Continental grounds, which is the biggest no-no an assassin can commit, John is going to be excommunicated from the hidden world of hitmen, which means they are all out to kill him for a global $14 million contract. You can't hide from the world, and you certainly can't fight them all off, but John Wick: Parabellum will make your heart race as our hero resolves to try.THE LOWDOWN: John Wick: Parabellum is an enthralling fast-paced, shoot-and-stab action movie with enough carnage for fans of Game of Thrones. In fact, I would say that the film is at least 70% fighting and action, and maybe 30% storytelling. The cast has more than a few stars, including Keanu Reeves, Halle Berry, and even Game of Thrones' Jerome Flynn alongside Orange is the New Black's Asia Kate Dillon. Not to mention, Laurence Fishburne will also reprise his role from John Wick 2 and sustain that Matrix reunion with Reeves. The plot, while entertaining, takes a slight backseat to the action and gives more than enough opportunities for John Wick to kill everyone in sight (plus a few more) in order to stay alive.TL;DR PEOPLE RATINGS (1-10 SCALE)THE FAMILY MOVIE NIGHT REVIEW - For parents and kids who love watching movies together - 3Unless your family is mostly grown or if you're willing to be a little more lenient with your kids, this is not a good movie to watch with children of any age.\nAlternatives (from PG-13 to PG): Tomb Raider, Black Panther, Kung Fu PandaTHE SQUEAMISH REVIEW - Lives for peace and love, pukes at the sight of blood - 2If lots of blood-and-guts violence grosses you out, make a different choice. You'll thank me later.\nAlternatives: A Disney movie\nTHE THRILL-SEEKER REVIEW- The action-film fanatic - 7What John Wick slightly lacks in storytelling, it makes up for with the most thrilling, unique, and realistic fight scenes. You will be on the edge of your seat as John fights against the world for his survival!\nAlternatives: Deadpool, The CommuterTHE FILM CONNOISSEUR REVIEW - A lover of cinema at its finest - 5.5As previously mentioned, John Wick: Parabellum IS NOT on par with some of the greatest films of all time, but because of its R-rating, it has the freedom to be realistic in terms of assassins fighting to the death. Plus, an original premise of a secret world of assassins is tempting, isn't it?\nAlternatives: Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill series, The Dark Knight trilogyTHE FEMINIST REVIEW - For people who love seeing powerful women - 6Halle Berry and Asia Kate Dillon are the two main leading ladies in this installment of the John Wick series. Berry plays a tough, ruthless assassin who isn't afraid to get her hands dirty, while Dillon plays an Adjudicator from the High Table, and pulls the strings in the operation to take down John. Berry's character is fun to watch and her loyal dogs add a little flair to her fighting style, while Dillon holds the power, but never gets physical in the process, which is slightly unnerving, since that is the opposite of what someone in her position would typically do. It's as if she is so high up on the administration of the High Table, that she is untouchable. It's different, which makes it interesting.\nAlternatives: Wonder Woman, Kill BillTHE HAYSTEW REVIEW - 7/10John Wick: Parabellum is a good movie, and it is definitely worth watching. If you are a Game of Thrones fan who is having withdrawal syndrome, this is perfect for you. Or if you are a Deadpool fan, this film will not be as wildly hilarious as the \"Merc with a Mouth\", but its got gore galore and a few moments of comedic relief. It is a novel and fascinating take, not only on the typical assassin movie, but also on the action genre as a whole. In terms of the acting, Reeves holds the hearts of the audience in the palm of his hands, and with every slice, stab, and shot, his grasp gets tighter and tighter. After it is over, viewers will walk out of the theaters feeling like a certified bada**.",

Don't get me wrong, the action sequences are beautifully choreographed and shot; particularly, that with the Chinese and French gangs, is extremely violent and shocking. The occasional references are also well appreciated (\"Guns, lots of guns.\" Anyone?) However, the story and characters are really lacking here. The main character John Wick is trying to avoid his fate of being hunt down by the high table after his deed in the second installment, but at this point he does not really have a better purpose, pretty much only for his own survival. The audience does not feel his sorrow or his desire for revenge, thus the connection to the main character is very weak. The movie becomes basically a martial art movie with lots of guns. Not a bad action movie, but not a John-Wick-level killer.",

Happy EndingSorry thats not my standard, its not 1970's its 2019 you need to be more real and practical. 07/ 10",

At some point something resembling a narrative HAS to take shape, right? And we all know Keanu can't act and that's part of his charm, but these lines are so cringey it almost hurts.Most action, while repetitive, is cool and the suits make it pop.

O\nPlus I start being annoyed by the gun porn - the ridiculously sultry descriptions and depictions of firearms and ammunition feel juvenile. Narratively it feels like three episodes of a TV series packed into a feature (45' of setup/obstacle/resolution/cliffhanger). The franchise seems to have lost what looked like a good chance to do a Banshee-like deep dive into the action genre and come out on the other side as something different and more thought-provoking. Hopefully chapter four will have some more courage.",

        "text": "John Wick 3 - This franchise has grown to be a holy achievement for any person eager to strap on for a full-ride of tense and jaw dropping action and excitement! We've come to expect these results, haven't we? The movie is balls to the walls action packed extravaganza, full tilt boom, cranked like a vice grip that isn't interested in holding back the prowess of their creation. Galloping one triumphant action feat to the next and doing so with style and rewarding with some substance and pay off, depending on your taste, maybe. This genre of filmmaking and the way it has been imagined and then translated to the screen is simply astounding. Truly visionary in terms of the look and feel, the set pieces and coordination/choreography of the cast members involved, truly outright epic-ness. A movie that has continued the way for a franchise to be noticed for the way results are produced. John Wick 3 is another solid entry and as good as ever.Kicking it off right where we had left off, there isn't much time for shenanigans and horseplay, because the clock is ticking, and man oh man, Mr. Wick has people smitten with him. We follow along for another daring and engrossing cat and mouse game. Mr. Wick will have his hands full being the hunted, once again, and attempting to make his way through these wild and inspired obstacles they have for his person, should be anything but light handed and idle.Always worth noting with such Art as this, is the ability to keep things never feeling numb or disinterested in what could follow, person(s) and places, props and blueprints of their wildest imagination, are at our disposable to digest and appreciate the sheer brilliance of this all. Director, Chad Stahelski, prior stuntman in the industry and body double for Keanu Reeves, has the talent and vision for such eye popping stylized action. A resume full of stunt work for multiple action movies has shown a person grow to an idolized action franchise film-director? Maybe, people, maybe. He's the real stuff on this platform and not many can hold a candle to his staggering entrance and staying on the scene, second to maybe, the RAID Franchise, he has forged his way to being mentioned with modern great action epics. Great work has been done, sir.Keanu Reeves ( The Matrix, Street Kings) has flourished in certain roles that he seems to take a direct adaptation to. He does well to embrace these rugged and disciplined actions for a job and does it with inspiration and commitment. This character/role has never floundered away from those sorts of idea(s) when thinking of what it takes to take on such badass stuff. This role has encapsulated past glories, for fans and the people who have grown up watching such hits like: Speed, Point Break, Constantine. Keanu Reeves owns this movie, the heart and soul of this breathtaking and daunting portrayal of a character on the big screen. Kudos to you, sir!John Wick 3 has fulfilled its purpose, more or less, what it had set out to do, was making a worthy potential conclusion to an adrenaline fueled franchise keen on destroying the standards set by other action's films. There are committed faces, old and new. Stunts and moves, fights and weapons, sleek and cool production value. I'd never miss a Wick entry at this point and with this one amongst it's others, I don't think you'd like to either, Have fun!",

It however is missing that John Wick charm and focus. This film branches out the assassin world which is a cool change of pace but unfortunately at the expense of exploring John Wick the man himself further. That is really my only critique of the film... They focus less on John and go a little far out left field. Still... Definitely worth seeing!",

A lot more variety and creativity in the fights, such as the use of knives and interaction with the environment. The action itself is smooth and has a special feel or realism in it that we've seen before. There is some more humor in this one and it's all very well timed with what's happening. Keanu Reeves does his thing and there is nothing else to say other than he's a man of focus, dedication, and sheer will. The movie also goes deeper into the world of John Wick and the assassins and we meet some new faces who are well established in their position. Overall, it's fun, badass, and has Keanu Reeves, so you can't go wrong with this one.",

Some fights are decent and they look like they probably took a lot of effort to practice, and the gun sequences are a bit more realistic since they include reloading and having to shoot the same guy multiple times, but in the end it's just an endless wave of idiots that get picked off 1 by 1 in a similar fashion, and gets dull quite fast (which is bad since those parts are long, specially the one in the desert).Plus the plot armor feeling is real; no matter how tired John is or how badly he's hurt, he keeps going. Which I get it, that's kind of the point of him being John Wick, but it just doesn't feel realistic.",
